  {
    q: "What is Full Loop CRM?",
    a: "Full Loop CRM is the first full-cycle CRM built specifically for home service businesses. It covers every stage of your business — from organic lead generation and AI-powered sales to scheduling, GPS-tracked field operations, payments, client feedback, and retargeting. One platform replaces Jobber, Housecall Pro, ServiceTitan, Mailchimp, SimpleTexting, Google Analytics, QuickBooks, and more. Built by Consortium NYC, the same team behind The NYC SEO.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does Full Loop CRM cost?",
    a: "The platform license is $25,000 per year. This includes all 7 business stages, the AI sales assistant (Selenas), all client and team portals, lead tracking, GPS operations, financial tools, and core updates. Installation and setup ranges from $5,000 to $15,000 depending on your business size. Optional monthly support retainers start at $750 per month. Every dollar goes into real infrastructure — not per-seat fees or per-lead charges.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does territory exclusivity mean?",
    a: "Full Loop CRM locks one service provider per trade per metropolitan area on a first-come, first-serve basis. If you are the cleaning company on Full Loop CRM in your metro, no other cleaning company in your market can access the same platform, the same leads, or the same organic domains. This prevents platform-based competition and gives you a permanent advantage. Once your territory is claimed, it is yours.",
  },
  {
    q: "What tools does Full Loop CRM replace?",
    a: "Full Loop CRM replaces 9+ traditional tools: Jobber (scheduling), Housecall Pro (field management), ServiceTitan (operations), Mailchimp (email marketing), SimpleTexting (SMS), Google Analytics (tracking), QuickBooks (finance), ReferralCandy (referrals), and any lead generation service you currently pay for. One login, zero integrations, no per-lead costs.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the AI sales assistant (Selenas)?",
    a: "Selenas is a 24/7 bilingual AI chatbot that engages leads via SMS the moment they come in. She qualifies prospects by location, service type, home size, and budget. She answers 12+ common questions about pricing, insurance, cancellation policies, and scheduling. She handles rescheduling and complaint escalation for existing clients. Full conversation transcripts are stored in every client profile. Selenas handles 80% of receptionist duties automatically — your phone stops ringing for questions that do not need you.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does lead generation work in Full Loop CRM?",
    a: "Full Loop CRM includes a multi-domain SEO strategy with neighborhood-specific websites. We build and manage 100+ domains targeting organic search across Google, Bing, ChatGPT, Claude, and DuckDuckGo. The attribution engine maps client addresses to domains with confidence scoring so you know exactly which neighborhood website generated each lead. No per-lead costs. No Google Ads dependency. Pure organic lead generation built into the platform.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Full Loop CRM work for my type of business?",
    a: "Full Loop CRM is built for any home service or field service business — cleaning services, carpet cleaning, window cleaning, pressure washing, landscaping, lawn care, handyman, pest control, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, painting, junk removal, pool cleaning, and more. If your business sends teams to customer locations on a scheduled or on-demand basis, Full Loop CRM is built for you.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does GPS tracking work?",
    a: "Team members check in and out of jobs using the bilingual team portal. GPS verification confirms they are within 528 feet of the job site. The system automatically calculates actual hours worked for payroll. You see real-time location of your teams in the admin dashboard. Emergency jobs can be broadcast to all available staff with one click.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there bilingual support?",
    a: "Yes. The entire team portal is available in English and Spanish with PIN-based login. The AI sales assistant Selenas is fully bilingual. Client communications can be sent in either language. This is critical for home service businesses in markets like NYC where bilingual operations are not optional — they are a competitive requirement.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does Full Loop CRM compare to ServiceTitan or Jobber?",
    a: "ServiceTitan and Jobber are operational tools — they help you schedule and dispatch. They do not generate leads. Full Loop CRM starts with lead generation and follows the customer through every stage: AI-powered sales, booking, field operations, payments, feedback, and retargeting. You do not need to bolt on Mailchimp, Thumbtack, or Google Ads to fill your schedule. The leads come from your own organic domains, owned by you, exclusive to your territory.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the tech stack behind Full Loop CRM?",
    a: "Full Loop CRM is built on the same modern stack we use for all Consortium NYC products — Next.js for the frontend, Supabase for the database and authentication, Vercel for hosting and deployment, Resend for transactional email, and Telnyx for SMS and voice. No WordPress. No legacy code. No plugin dependencies. This stack delivers sub-1-second load times, 99.9% uptime, and the ability to scale to thousands of concurrent users without performance degradation.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who built Full Loop CRM?",
    a: "Full Loop CRM is built and owned by Consortium NYC — the same company behind The NYC SEO. We have 25+ years of experience in home services, web development, SEO, and business growth strategy. We built Full Loop CRM because every CRM we tried was missing the most important piece: lead generation. So we built one that starts with leads and handles everything that comes after.",

            <p>
              Most CRMs are glorified scheduling tools. Jobber helps you dispatch. Housecall Pro helps you invoice. ServiceTitan helps you manage operations. But none of them answer the most important question:{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">where do the leads come from?</strong>{" "}
              Without a real{" "}

              baked into your CRM, you are always dependent on rented traffic.
            </p>
            <p>
              So you end up paying Thumbtack $50 per lead — shared with 4 competitors. You run Google Ads at $30 to $85 per click. You list on Yelp and pray. You bolt together 9 different tools with 9 different logins, 9 different bills, and zero integration between them. Your leads go into one system, your schedule lives in another, your payments in a third, and you have no idea which marketing dollar actually produced which customer. Without proper{" "}
              <Link href="/services/analytics-reporting" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">analytics and reporting</Link>, you are flying blind.
            </p>
            <p>
              Full Loop CRM was built because we lived this problem. After 25+ years of building{" "}

              for home service businesses, we knew the CRM market was broken. Every tool solved one piece. None solved the full loop. So we built one that does — from the first Google search to the five-star review.

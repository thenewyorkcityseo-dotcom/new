const faqs = [
  {
    q: "How long does SEO take for a home service business in NYC?",
    a: "Most home service businesses see measurable ranking improvements within 60 to 90 days. Google Business Profile optimizations can impact Maps visibility within weeks. Competitive trades like plumbing and HVAC in dense boroughs like Manhattan and Brooklyn may take 4 to 6 months for consistent top-3 local pack positions. We provide monthly reporting so you see movement from day one, and our programmatic neighborhood pages start indexing within the first 30 days.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does SEO cost for a plumber or electrician in NYC?",
    a: "Our SEO retainers for home service businesses start at $3,500 per month. This includes Google Business Profile optimization, local citation building across 80+ directories, neighborhood-targeted landing pages, on-page SEO, content strategy, and monthly reporting. Project-based engagements like a full website rebuild with SEO architecture start at $2,500. Consulting is available at $150 per hour for businesses that want expert guidance but prefer to execute in-house.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you work with home service businesses outside Manhattan?",
    a: "Absolutely. We build SEO platforms for home service businesses across all five boroughs, plus Northern New Jersey, Long Island, and Westchester County. In fact, outer borough and suburban markets often present the best ROI opportunities because competition is lower than Manhattan while search volume remains strong. A roofer in Staten Island or an HVAC company in Queens can dominate their local market faster than a competitor trying to rank in Midtown.",
  },
  {
    q: "What makes SEO different for home service businesses vs. other industries?",
    a: "Home service SEO is driven by emergency and near-me search intent. When a pipe bursts at 2 AM, the homeowner searches 'emergency plumber near me' and calls the first business they see. This means Google Business Profile optimization, review velocity, and local pack rankings matter more than long-form blog content. We also build programmatic pages for every service-neighborhood combination — 'electrician Park Slope,' 'HVAC repair Astoria,' 'roofer Bay Ridge' — because home service searches are inherently hyperlocal.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you help a home service business that already has a website?",
    a: "Yes. Most of our home service clients come to us with an existing website — often built on WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace — that is underperforming in search. We audit the site for technical SEO issues, content gaps, and structural problems, then either optimize the existing site or rebuild it on Next.js for maximum performance. We never throw away what is working. If your current site has backlinks and domain authority, we preserve that equity while fixing everything that is holding you back.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you handle SEO for multi-trade home service companies?",
    a: "Multi-trade companies — general contractors who do plumbing, electrical, and renovation work, for example — need a hub-and-spoke content architecture. We create dedicated service pages for each trade, neighborhood pages for each service area, and cross-linked category pages that signal topical authority to Google. This prevents keyword cannibalization (where your plumbing page and your electrical page compete against each other) and ensures each service line ranks independently.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you optimize for AI search platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity?",
    a: "Yes. AI search optimization is built into every campaign. When a homeowner asks ChatGPT 'who is the best plumber in Brooklyn,' the answer is pulled from structured data, authoritative content, and consistent business information across the web. Our SEO strategies — schema markup, citation consistency, review signals, and comprehensive content — are exactly what AI search platforms use to recommend businesses. We optimize for Google, Bing, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini simultaneously.",
  },
  {
    q: "What kind of results can a home service business expect from SEO?",
    a: "Our home service clients typically see a 3x to 5x increase in organic leads within 6 to 12 months. This translates to more phone calls from Google Maps, more form submissions from organic search, and more visibility in AI search results. A typical plumber or electrician ranking in the local pack for their top 10 keywords receives 40 to 80 calls per month from Google alone. The math is simple: if your average job is $500 and you close 30% of inbound calls, 60 monthly calls equals $9,000 in new revenue — from a $3,500/month investment.",

            <p>
              New York City has over 45,000 licensed contractors competing for the same homeowners. When someone&rsquo;s boiler dies in January or a pipe bursts at midnight, they don&rsquo;t flip through the Yellow Pages — they grab their phone and search. The{" "}

              The home services industry is one of the most competitive{" "}

              markets in the country. Google Ads for plumber and HVAC keywords in NYC cost $45 to $85 per click — and that is before you factor in the 70% of clicks that go to organic results, not ads. Businesses that invest in{" "}

              stop paying per click and start building an asset that generates leads month after month.
            </p>
            <p>
              The challenge is that most home service businesses try to handle SEO themselves — or hire a general marketing agency that doesn&rsquo;t understand the trades. They end up with a WordPress site that loads in 8 seconds, no{" "}

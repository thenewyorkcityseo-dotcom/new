const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What is an SEO strategy and why do I need one?",
    a: "An SEO strategy is a documented plan that defines exactly how your business will rank in search engines and AI platforms. It includes competitor analysis, keyword research, content planning, technical priorities, and a timeline for execution. Without a strategy, SEO becomes a series of random tactics — fixing a title tag here, writing a blog post there — with no clear direction. A strategy ensures every action is intentional, prioritized by impact, and aligned with your business goals. It is the difference between guessing and knowing.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to develop an SEO strategy?",
    a: "A comprehensive SEO strategy for a single-location service business typically takes 2 to 3 weeks to complete. Multi-location businesses or highly competitive industries may take 3 to 4 weeks. This includes the discovery call, competitor analysis, keyword research, technical audit, content gap analysis, local search mapping, AI search assessment, and roadmap creation. We do not rush this process because getting the strategy right is more important than starting fast. A bad strategy executed quickly costs more than a good strategy delivered in three weeks.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does a custom SEO strategy cost?",
    a: "Our standalone SEO strategy and audit packages range from $2,500 to $7,500 depending on the scope — number of services, number of locations, competitive landscape, and current website complexity. For businesses that move into a monthly SEO campaign, the strategy cost is credited toward the first month. Monthly campaigns start at $3,500 per month for single-location businesses, $7,500 per month for multi-service or multi-borough campaigns, and $15,000+ per month for businesses that want to dominate their entire market.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between an SEO strategy and an SEO audit?",
    a: "An SEO audit tells you what is wrong. An SEO strategy tells you what to do about it — and in what order. An audit identifies technical issues, content gaps, backlink problems, and competitive weaknesses. A strategy takes those findings and builds a prioritized action plan with timelines, KPIs, and expected outcomes. We deliver both as part of our strategy engagement because you need the diagnosis before you can build the treatment plan.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a new website before investing in SEO strategy?",
    a: "Not necessarily, but it depends on your current site. If your site is built on a modern framework with clean code, good page speed, and solid architecture, we can optimize what you have. If your site is on WordPress with bloated plugins, 5-second load times, and poor Core Web Vitals, the strategy will likely recommend a rebuild on Next.js before investing in content and link building. There is no point building on a broken foundation. Our strategy will give you an honest assessment of whether your current site can support serious SEO or needs to be replaced.",
  },
  {
    q: "What tools do you use for SEO research and analysis?",
    a: "We use a combination of professional-grade tools: Ahrefs for backlink analysis and keyword research, Screaming Frog for technical crawl audits, Google Search Console for indexation and performance data, Google Analytics for traffic and conversion data, Semrush for competitive intelligence, Surfer SEO for content optimization benchmarks, and proprietary scripts for AI search visibility testing across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude. We also use custom automation built on our own tech stack for large-scale keyword mapping and content gap analysis.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is your SEO strategy different from what other agencies offer?",
    a: "Three ways. First, we include AI search assessment as a core component — most agencies are not even thinking about ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini yet. Second, our strategies are built specifically for local service businesses in the NYC metro area. We know this market, we know the search dynamics, and we know what it takes to rank here. Third, we do not hand you a generic PDF and disappear. Our strategies include specific page templates, URL structures, schema recommendations, and a 90-day implementation roadmap with weekly priorities. You could hand it to any developer and they could execute it.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I already have an SEO agency — can you audit their work?",
    a: "Absolutely. We regularly audit the work of other agencies for businesses that suspect they are not getting results. We will analyze your current rankings, review the technical health of your site, assess the quality of backlinks being built, evaluate content quality, and check whether structured data is properly implemented. We provide an honest, data-backed assessment of whether your current agency is doing quality work or wasting your budget. If they are doing well, we will tell you. If they are not, we will show you exactly where they are falling short.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you help with strategy implementation or just planning?",
    a: "Both. Our standalone strategy package delivers a complete roadmap that any qualified team can execute. But most clients choose to have us implement the strategy through our monthly SEO campaigns because we built the plan and know exactly how to execute it. Implementation includes on-page optimization, technical fixes, content creation, programmatic page generation, link building, local SEO, and AI search optimization. The strategy is the blueprint — implementation is the construction.",
  },
  {
    q: "What KPIs should I track to measure SEO success?",
    a: "The primary KPIs we track are: organic traffic growth (month over month), keyword rankings for target terms (positions 1-3, 4-10, 11-20), click-through rate from search results, conversion rate from organic traffic (phone calls, form submissions, chats), cost per lead from organic versus paid channels, Core Web Vitals scores, pages indexed in Google, and AI search visibility (how often your business is recommended by ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI platforms). We establish baseline metrics during the strategy phase and set specific targets for 30, 60, and 90 days.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you handle keyword research for businesses serving multiple neighborhoods?",
    a: "We map every service you offer to every neighborhood you serve, creating a complete keyword matrix. A plumber offering 8 services across 40 neighborhoods has at least 320 primary keyword targets. We research search volume, competition, and intent for each combination, then prioritize based on revenue potential and competitive difficulty. This matrix becomes the blueprint for programmatic page generation — creating unique, optimized landing pages for each service-location combination. We also identify long-tail variations, question queries, and AI search phrases for each combination.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is local search mapping and why does it matter for my business?",
    a: "Local search mapping is the process of identifying every geographic search query relevant to your business and matching it to a content strategy. For a moving company in NYC, this means mapping searches like 'movers Upper East Side,' 'moving company Brooklyn Heights,' 'long distance movers Queens,' and hundreds more across every neighborhood. Without this mapping, you are leaving massive amounts of local search traffic on the table. With it, you have a clear blueprint for building location-specific pages that capture customers in every area you serve.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is an AI search assessment and why should I care?",
    a: "An AI search assessment evaluates how your business appears — or does not appear — when someone asks ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, or Claude for a service provider in your area. Over 100 million people use ChatGPT monthly, and AI search is growing faster than any channel since mobile. We test dozens of prompts relevant to your business and document where you appear, where competitors appear, and what signals the AI models are using to make recommendations. Then we build a strategy to improve your AI visibility through structured data, content clarity, and entity optimization.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you build an SEO strategy for a brand new website?",
    a: "Yes — and in many ways, it is easier. A new website is a blank slate with no technical debt, no toxic backlinks, and no penalties to recover from. We design the strategy from the ground up: optimal site architecture, URL structure, content hierarchy, schema markup, and keyword targeting. New sites built on Next.js with a proper SEO strategy from day one typically see meaningful rankings within 60 to 90 days for low-competition keywords and 4 to 6 months for competitive terms. Starting with strategy is always faster than trying to fix a poorly built site later.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often should an SEO strategy be updated?",
    a: "We recommend a full strategy refresh every 6 to 12 months. Search algorithms change, new competitors enter your market, AI platforms evolve, and your business priorities shift. Between full refreshes, we make tactical adjustments monthly based on performance data — doubling down on what is working and pivoting away from what is not. The initial strategy sets the direction; ongoing optimization keeps you on course. SEO strategy is not a one-time document — it is a living plan that evolves with your market.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens after I receive my SEO strategy?",
    a: "You have two options. First, you can take the strategy and hand it to your internal team or another agency for implementation. The deliverable is detailed enough for any qualified developer or SEO professional to execute. Second, you can engage us to implement it through one of our monthly SEO campaigns. Most clients choose option two because we built the strategy and can execute it faster and more accurately than someone reading our documentation cold. Either way, you own the strategy — it is yours to keep regardless of whether you continue working with us.",

            What Is an SEO Strategy and Why Does It Come First?
          </h2>
          <div className="mt-8 space-y-6 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              An SEO strategy is the documented plan that tells you exactly how to get from where you are today to where you want to be in search rankings. It defines which keywords to target, which pages to build, which technical issues to fix, how to structure your content, and in what order to do all of it. Without a strategy, SEO becomes a collection of random tactics — optimizing a title tag here, writing a blog post there, building a few backlinks somewhere — with no clear direction and no way to measure whether any of it is actually working.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is why most businesses fail at SEO. They skip straight to tactics. They hire an agency that starts &ldquo;doing SEO&rdquo; without ever asking the fundamental questions: Who are your competitors? What keywords actually drive revenue in your market? What does your site architecture need to look like? Where are the content gaps? What is your{" "}
              <Link href="/services/ai-search-optimization" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">AI search visibility</Link>{" "}
              situation? Without answering these questions, every dollar you spend on SEO is a gamble — and most businesses lose that gamble for months or years before they realize the problem was never execution. The problem was the absence of a plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              A proper SEO strategy changes everything. Instead of guessing which keywords to target, you know — because you have data showing search volume, competition level, and revenue potential for every term. Instead of wondering what pages to build, you have a complete site architecture map with every URL defined, every content template ready, and every{" "}

Which ones are the most profitable? Which neighborhoods do you serve? Where do you want to expand? Who are your best customers and how do they find you today? What has your previous SEO experience been — good, bad, or nonexistent? We review your existing website, Google Analytics, Google Search Console data, and any previous SEO audits or reports. We also examine your Google Business Profile, review profiles, and local citations. This call is not a sales pitch — it is a working session that sets the foundation for everything that follows.

We document every gap — where they rank and you do not, where their content is thin and yours could be better, where their backlink profile is weak, and where they have completely ignored AI search optimization.

We categorize every keyword by search intent — navigational, informational, transactional, or local — and map each one to a specific page on your site. We calculate the revenue potential of each keyword cluster based on search volume, click-through rate benchmarks, and your average customer value.

For businesses that serve multiple neighborhoods, we build the blueprint for programmatic page generation — creating unique, optimized landing pages for every service-location combination. A plumber offering 10 services across 50 neighborhoods needs 500+ pages. We define the template, content variables, schema markup, and internal linking for each.

We analyze the signals AI models use to recommend businesses: structured data quality, content clarity, entity associations, review signals, citation consistency, and domain authority. We then define the specific optimizations needed to improve your AI recommendations — from schema markup improvements to content restructuring to entity optimization.

                Generic SEO packages treat every business the same. You get a predetermined number of keywords, a set amount of content, and a cookie-cutter link building plan — regardless of your market, your competition, or your business goals. A{" "}

                in Manhattan have completely different competitive landscapes, keyword economics, and content requirements. A generic package cannot account for these differences. A custom strategy is built from scratch based on your specific market data, competitor analysis, and business goals. It tells you exactly which keywords to target, which pages to build, and in what order — because the data says so, not because it is on a template.

              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                Keyword research is one piece of an SEO strategy — but it is not the strategy itself. You can spend hours in a keyword tool pulling search volumes and difficulty scores, but without competitive analysis, intent mapping, content architecture planning, technical audit findings, and AI search assessment, you are missing 80% of the picture. DIY keyword research tells you what people search. A custom strategy tells you what to do about it — which pages to build, how to structure them, how to link them together, what schema to implement, and how to beat the specific competitors ranking for each term. The keyword list is the ingredient list. The strategy is the recipe.

              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                &ldquo;Just do what they are doing&rdquo; is the most dangerous SEO advice in existence. Copying a competitor means you are always behind — you are building what they built last year while they are already working on what comes next. You also cannot see what is happening behind their rankings: you do not know which pages are actually driving leads, which backlinks are moving the needle, or whether their traffic is even converting. A custom strategy does not copy competitors — it dissects them. We analyze what is working for them, what is not, and where the gaps are that they have missed entirely. Then we build a plan to leapfrog them by doing what they cannot or will not do — like{" "}
                <Link href="/services/automation" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">programmatic page generation</Link>{" "}
                at scale or{" "}

                before they even know it matters.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#EFF70A]">Custom SEO Strategy vs. &ldquo;We&apos;ll Figure It Out as We Go&rdquo;</h3>
              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                This is the most expensive approach of all, because it costs you time. Time spent optimizing the wrong keywords. Time spent building pages that no one searches for. Time spent fixing technical issues that should have been identified on day one. Time is the one resource you cannot get back, and in competitive NYC markets, every month you spend wandering without a plan is a month your competitors are executing with one. The average business that starts SEO without a strategy wastes 3 to 6 months before they realize they need to course-correct. That is $10,000 to $90,000 in wasted budget. A $2,500 to $7,500 strategy upfront saves you multiples of that by ensuring every dollar goes toward actions with proven ROI.

              &ldquo;The SEO strategy The NYC SEO built for us was a complete game-changer. Our previous agency had us targeting the wrong keywords for two years — broad terms with massive competition that we had no chance of ranking for. The NYC SEO identified 150+ long-tail keywords we had never considered, mapped out a content plan that covered every neighborhood we serve, and gave us a clear 90-day roadmap. Within 4 months of implementing their strategy, our organic leads tripled and our cost per lead dropped by 60%. The strategy paid for itself in the first week of results.&rdquo;

            We see these mistakes every week from businesses that skipped strategy or worked with agencies that did not know better. Every one of them is fixable — but only if you know to look for them.

We analyze the top 10 to 15 competitors in your market — their keywords, content, backlinks, and AI visibility — before we recommend a single optimization. Knowing the competitive landscape is what separates strategic SEO from blind guessing.",

We build hub-and-spoke content models where service hub pages link to location pages, which link to FAQ content, which links back to the hub. This structure signals expertise to both search engines and AI platforms.",

We map every service to every neighborhood and build the blueprint for{' '}<Link href='/services/automation' className='text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]'>programmatic page generation</Link> — hundreds of unique, optimized pages targeting real local search queries.",

If your strategy does not include an{' '}<Link href='/services/ai-search-optimization' className='text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]'>AI search optimization</Link> component, you are planning for 2020, not 2026.

                even means. We have been optimizing for ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude since these platforms started recommending local businesses. Every strategy we build includes a comprehensive AI search assessment and a dedicated plan for improving your visibility in AI-generated recommendations. The agencies that figure this out first will dominate the next decade of search. We are already there — and our strategies ensure our clients are too.

              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                We do not deliver 100-page PDFs full of jargon and pie charts that no one reads. Our strategies are actionable implementation documents. Every recommendation includes specific instructions: which pages to build, what URLs to use, what schema to implement, what content to write, what links to pursue, and in what order. You could hand our strategy document to any qualified developer or SEO professional and they could start executing on day one. That is the standard. If a strategy is not actionable, it is not a strategy — it is a book report.

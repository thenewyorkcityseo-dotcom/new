const faqs = [
  {
    q: "How does SEO work for law firms in NYC?",
    a: "Law firm SEO combines aggressive local search optimization with practice-area content strategy. We optimize your Google Business Profile for legal categories, build citations on legal directories like Avvo, FindLaw, Justia, Super Lawyers, and Martindale-Hubbell, create practice-area pages targeting high-value case types, and build neighborhood-targeted pages for every jurisdiction you serve. The goal is to rank in the Google Maps local pack and organic results when potential clients search 'personal injury lawyer near me,' 'divorce attorney Brooklyn,' or 'immigration lawyer Queens' — the exact moment they need legal help.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does SEO cost for a law firm in New York City?",
    a: "Our law firm SEO retainers start at $3,500 per month. This includes Google Business Profile optimization, legal directory citations, practice-area content development, neighborhood-targeted landing pages, review generation systems, and monthly reporting with lead attribution. Project-based work like a full website rebuild with SEO architecture starts at $2,500. Consulting is available at $150 per hour for firms with in-house marketing teams. Given that a single personal injury case can be worth $50,000 to $500,000+ in fees, SEO delivers the highest ROI of any marketing channel for law firms.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does SEO take for a law firm to see results?",
    a: "Law firms typically see Google Maps local pack improvement within 60 to 90 days. Organic rankings for practice-area keywords take 3 to 6 months depending on competition. Competitive practice areas like personal injury in Manhattan — where firms spend $200+ per click on Google Ads — take 6 to 9 months for consistent page-one positions. Less competitive practice areas and outer borough markets often see faster results. We provide monthly reporting so you see progress from the first month, and our programmatic pages begin indexing within 30 days.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which practice areas benefit most from SEO in NYC?",
    a: "Every practice area benefits, but the highest-ROI practice areas for SEO are personal injury (case values of $100K+), criminal defense (high urgency, immediate search), immigration (massive NYC demand), family law and divorce (high search volume), estate planning (high lifetime value), and real estate law (transaction-driven search patterns). The common thread is that potential clients search Google at the moment of need — after an accident, after an arrest, when facing deportation, or during a divorce. SEO puts your firm in front of them at that critical moment.",
  },
  {
    q: "How competitive is SEO for personal injury lawyers in NYC?",
    a: "Personal injury is the most competitive legal SEO market in the country, and NYC is the most competitive city. Google Ads for 'personal injury lawyer NYC' costs $200 to $400 per click. The firms ranking organically for these keywords get hundreds of free clicks per month that would cost $40,000 to $80,000+ monthly through paid ads. This is why the top personal injury firms invest heavily in SEO — the organic rankings are worth millions in annual lead generation. We have the experience and methodology to compete in this space, but we are transparent: it takes 6 to 12 months to build top-3 rankings for the most competitive PI keywords.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you help law firms with Google Ads alongside SEO?",
    a: "We focus exclusively on organic search — SEO, local SEO, content marketing, and AI search optimization. We do not manage Google Ads campaigns. However, we frequently work alongside PPC agencies, and our SEO strategy complements paid advertising. Many of our law firm clients run Google Ads during the first 6 months while organic rankings build, then reduce ad spend as SEO takes over. The combination provides immediate visibility (ads) plus long-term asset building (SEO).",
  },
  {
    q: "How do client reviews impact law firm SEO rankings?",
    a: "Client reviews are one of the top three ranking factors for the Google Maps local pack. Law firms with more reviews, higher ratings, and recent review activity outrank competitors with fewer or older reviews. In NYC legal markets, the firms in the local pack typically have 75 to 200+ Google reviews with 4.7+ star averages. We implement ethical review generation systems — automated post-case emails and follow-up sequences — that grow your review count while complying with bar association advertising rules. Every review response is templated to reinforce practice area keywords and geographic relevance.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you help a solo practitioner compete with large NYC law firms?",
    a: "Absolutely. Solo practitioners and small firms often outperform large firms in local SEO because they can be more agile, more responsive to reviews, and more focused on specific practice areas and neighborhoods. A solo immigration lawyer in Jackson Heights who dominates 'immigration lawyer Jackson Heights' and 'immigration attorney Queens' will generate more relevant leads than a large firm trying to rank citywide. We build hyper-targeted strategies for solo practitioners that maximize visibility in their specific practice area and geographic market.",

          </h2>
          <div className="mt-8 space-y-6 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              New York City has over 180,000 licensed attorneys — more than any other city on earth. Every practice area, from{" "}
              <Link href="/personal-injury-lawyer" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">personal injury</Link>{" "}
              to{" "}

              <Link href="/divorce-lawyer" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">family law</Link>, is saturated with competitors all fighting for the same clients. Referrals and word-of-mouth still matter, but the reality is that 96% of people seeking legal advice start with a search engine. The firms that dominate Google dominate their market.
            </p>
            <p>
              Legal keywords are among the most expensive in all of online advertising. &ldquo;Personal injury lawyer NYC&rdquo; costs $200 to $400 per click on Google Ads. &ldquo;Mesothelioma lawyer&rdquo; can exceed $900 per click. A firm spending $20,000 per month on ads gets maybe 100 clicks — and only a fraction convert to consultations. The firms ranking organically for these same keywords get those clicks for free, every month, indefinitely. That is the power of{" "}
              <Link href="/services/seo-strategy" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">SEO strategy</Link>{" "}
              — you stop renting visibility and start owning it.
            </p>
            <p>
              AI search is accelerating this shift. When a potential client asks ChatGPT &ldquo;who is the best personal injury lawyer in Brooklyn,&rdquo; the answer is drawn from the same signals that power Google rankings: authoritative content, consistent business data, client reviews, and structured data markup. Law firms that invest in{" "}
              <Link href="/services/ai-search-optimization" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">AI search optimization</Link>{" "}
              and{" "}
              <Link href="/services/content-marketing" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">content marketing</Link>{" "}
              now are building the client pipeline that will sustain their practice for the next decade. Firms that rely on ads and referrals alone are watching their market share erode with every AI search that does not mention them.

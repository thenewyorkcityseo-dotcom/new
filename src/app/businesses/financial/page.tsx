  {
    q: "How long does it take for a financial services firm to rank on Google in NYC?",
    a: "Most financial services businesses begin seeing measurable ranking improvements within 3-4 months of sustained SEO work. Competitive terms like 'accountant NYC' or 'financial advisor Manhattan' can take 6-9 months to crack the top 5, depending on domain age, backlink profile, and how aggressively competitors are investing in SEO. Local pack results (Google Maps) often move faster, sometimes within 8-12 weeks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is SEO important for accountants and financial advisors specifically?",
    a: "Financial services are high-intent, high-value searches. Someone searching 'CPA near me' or 'tax preparer NYC' is ready to hire. Unlike referral-based growth that caps out, SEO compounds over time, bringing in new clients month after month without paying per click. In NYC's saturated financial market, firms that don't invest in organic visibility are leaving six figures in annual revenue to competitors who do.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does a financial services SEO strategy include?",
    a: "Our strategy covers technical SEO (site speed, indexation, schema markup), local SEO (Google Business Profile optimization, citation building, review management), content marketing (blog posts targeting financial questions your clients search), on-page optimization for service and location pages, and AI search optimization so your firm surfaces in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini responses.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does SEO cost for a financial services business in NYC?",
    a: "Our monthly retainer starts at $3,500/month for ongoing SEO, which includes strategy, content, technical optimization, and reporting. Project-based work starts at $2,500, and consulting is available at $150/hour. The ROI for financial services SEO is among the highest of any industry because client lifetime values often exceed $5,000-$50,000+.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you help our firm rank in AI search results like ChatGPT?",
    a: "Yes. AI search optimization is a core part of our approach. We structure your content, schema markup, and authority signals so that large language models like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google Gemini reference your firm when users ask questions like 'best accountant in Brooklyn' or 'financial advisor for small business NYC.' This is the next frontier of client acquisition.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you work with solo practitioners or only large financial firms?",
    a: "We work with both. Solo CPAs and independent financial advisors benefit enormously from local SEO because they're competing with larger firms that have bigger budgets. Our programmatic approach builds hundreds of location-specific pages that a solo practitioner could never create manually, giving small firms enterprise-level visibility at a fraction of the cost.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between SEO and Google Ads for financial services?",
    a: "Google Ads deliver instant visibility but stop the moment you pause spend. SEO builds compounding organic traffic that grows over time without per-click costs. For financial services, where CPCs run $15-$50+ per click, SEO delivers dramatically better long-term ROI. We recommend SEO as the foundation and paid ads as a short-term supplement while organic rankings build.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you track SEO results for our financial practice?",
    a: "We provide monthly reporting through our analytics dashboard that tracks keyword rankings, organic traffic, Google Business Profile views, phone calls, form submissions, and new client inquiries. Every metric is tied to real business outcomes, not vanity numbers. You'll see exactly how SEO translates to new client acquisition.",

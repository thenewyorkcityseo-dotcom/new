  {
    q: "How long does it take to rank a pet service business on Google?",
    a: "Most pet service businesses see measurable ranking improvements within 3-6 months. Dog walkers and groomers targeting neighborhood-level keywords can rank faster because the competition is hyper-local. Citywide rankings for terms like 'best dog trainer NYC' take longer — typically 6-12 months depending on your existing web presence.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is SEO worth it for a dog walking business?",
    a: "Absolutely. Dog walkers depend on trust and proximity — pet owners search for walkers near their home. Local SEO puts your business in front of owners in your exact neighborhood through Google Maps, organic results, and AI search tools. One new recurring client covers your monthly SEO investment multiple times over.",
  },
  {
    q: "What keywords do pet service businesses need to target?",
    a: "The highest-value keywords combine your service type with location: 'dog groomer Upper West Side,' 'dog trainer Brooklyn Heights,' 'pet sitter near me.' We also target long-tail queries like 'best dog walker for anxious dogs NYC' and 'affordable puppy training Manhattan' that signal high purchase intent.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you optimize Google Business Profiles for pet businesses?",
    a: "Yes — Google Business Profile optimization is a core part of every pet service SEO engagement. We optimize your categories, service areas, business description, photos, and review strategy. For pet businesses, GBP drives more leads than organic search because pet owners rely heavily on Maps results and reviews.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can SEO help my pet business show up in AI search results?",
    a: "Yes. Our AI search optimization ensures your pet business appears in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and other AI-powered search tools. As more pet owners ask AI assistants to recommend dog walkers and groomers, being cited in those answers becomes a significant competitive advantage.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's included in the $3,500/month retainer for pet service SEO?",
    a: "The retainer covers keyword strategy, on-page SEO, Google Business Profile management, content creation, local citation building, review strategy, monthly reporting, and AI search optimization. For pet businesses we also build neighborhood-level landing pages targeting the specific areas you serve.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you build websites for pet service businesses?",
    a: "Yes. We build fast, SEO-optimized websites designed to convert pet owners into customers. Every site includes location pages for your service areas, service pages for each offering, a review showcase, online booking integration, and full mobile optimization — because most pet owners search on their phones.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you measure SEO results for pet businesses?",
    a: "We track keyword rankings, organic traffic, Google Business Profile views and actions, phone calls, form submissions, and direction requests. You get a monthly report showing exactly how many new pet owners found your business through search. We also track AI search citations and referral traffic from ChatGPT and Perplexity.",

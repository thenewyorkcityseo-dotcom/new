  const seoFaqs = [
    {
      q: "How much does SEO cost for an event business in NYC?",
      a: "SEO retainers for event businesses start at $3,500/month, covering local SEO, Google Business Profile optimization, content marketing, on-page SEO, and AI search optimization. Project-based work like website builds or portfolio optimization starts at $2,500. The investment depends on your competitive landscape, the types of events you serve, and how many neighborhoods you want to rank in. A wedding photographer targeting all of Brooklyn needs more than one focusing on DUMBO.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long until my event business ranks on Google in NYC?",
      a: "Most event businesses see measurable ranking improvements in 60-90 days, with significant gains in 4-6 months. Google Business Profile optimizations can impact your Maps ranking within weeks. The event industry in NYC is highly competitive, especially for wedding-related keywords — top positions in neighborhoods like the West Village, Tribeca, and DUMBO take dedicated effort over 4-8 months. We provide monthly progress reports from day one.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you work with all types of event businesses?",
      a: "Yes. We build SEO platforms for wedding planners, event planners, DJs, photographers, videographers, florists, and party rental companies. Each business type gets a tailored keyword strategy because someone searching for a wedding photographer has completely different intent and buying timeline than someone looking for a DJ for a corporate party.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can you help my event business show up on ChatGPT and Perplexity?",
      a: "Yes. AI search optimization is one of our core services. When a couple asks ChatGPT 'best wedding photographer in Brooklyn' or a corporate planner asks Perplexity 'event planners for product launches in NYC,' we structure your content so your business gets recommended. We build the entity relationships, portfolio signals, and structured data that AI platforms use to generate answers.",
    },
    {
      q: "How important is SEO for wedding businesses specifically?",
      a: "Extremely important. Couples typically start searching for wedding vendors 12-18 months before their date, and 97% of that research starts online. The NYC wedding market is worth over $3.5 billion annually. If your wedding planning, photography, or DJ business is not ranking for 'wedding photographer NYC' and neighborhood-specific variations, you are losing bookings to competitors who invested in SEO.",
    },
    {
      q: "What makes your agency different for event business SEO?",
      a: "Three things. First, we build on Next.js, not WordPress, so your portfolio loads instantly on any device — critical when brides and event planners are comparing dozens of vendors. Second, we use programmatic SEO to generate hundreds of neighborhood-specific pages at scale. Third, we optimize for AI search platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity, which are rapidly becoming how couples and corporate planners discover vendors. Full Loop CRM ensures every inquiry gets followed up on.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you build location pages for event businesses?",
      a: `Yes. We generate optimized landing pages for every neighborhood you serve. A wedding photographer targeting the full NYC metro area gets ${totalNeighborhoods}+ unique pages — each targeting searches like "wedding photographer DUMBO" or "DJ for hire Hoboken" with original content, portfolio samples, schema markup, and internal linking.`,
    },
    {
      q: "How do you handle portfolio and gallery SEO for photographers and videographers?",
      a: "We optimize every image and video with descriptive file names, alt text targeting venue and event-type keywords, lazy loading for fast page speeds, structured data markup (ImageObject, VideoObject), and gallery pages organized by event type and venue. This turns your portfolio into a search engine asset, not just a visual showcase. Each gallery page targets specific keywords like 'Brooklyn winery wedding photos' or 'rooftop event videography NYC.'",

A wedding photographer in Brooklyn faces different competition than a corporate event planner in Midtown — we map each landscape separately." },

Build a Portfolio-Driven Website", detail: "We build (or rebuild) your site on Next.js with blazing-fast portfolio galleries, inquiry forms, pricing guides, venue pages, and testimonials. Mobile-first because couples and planners browse vendors on their phones. Scores 95+ on Core Web Vitals." },

Optimize Every Page for Search", detail: "On-page SEO across your entire site — title tags targeting 'wedding planner Brooklyn,' ImageObject schema for portfolio galleries, venue-specific landing pages, internal linking architecture, and image optimization that loads fast without sacrificing visual quality." },

Each page targets "photographer in [neighborhood]" or "DJ near [neighborhood]" with unique content, portfolio samples from local events, and internal links to your services.` },

Dominate Google Maps & Directories", detail: "Full Google Business Profile optimization, citation building across 50+ event directories (The Knot, WeddingWire, Zola, Yelp, Bark), review generation with post-event email sequences, and geo-grid rank tracking for your target neighborhoods." },

Build Authority with Content & Links", detail: "Ongoing content marketing (venue guides, event planning checklists, seasonal trend posts, real wedding features) and off-page SEO (editorial backlinks from wedding publications, venue partnership links, local press features) to build domain authority." },

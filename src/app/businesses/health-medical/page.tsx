const faqs = [
  {
    q: "How does SEO work for healthcare practices in NYC?",
    a: "Healthcare SEO combines local search optimization with HIPAA-compliant content strategy. We optimize your Google Business Profile for medical categories, build citations on healthcare-specific directories like Healthgrades, Zocdoc, Vitals, and WebMD, create condition-specific and treatment-specific landing pages, and build neighborhood-targeted pages for every area you serve. The goal is to appear in the Google Maps local pack and organic results when patients search for your specialty in their neighborhood — 'dentist Upper East Side,' 'chiropractor Park Slope,' 'therapist near me Brooklyn.'",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does SEO take for a medical practice in NYC?",
    a: "Healthcare practices typically see local pack movement within 60 to 90 days as Google Business Profile optimizations, citation building, and review strategies take effect. Organic rankings for condition and treatment keywords take 3 to 6 months depending on competition. Competitive specialties like dentistry and med spas in Manhattan may take 6 to 9 months for top-3 positions, while practices in outer boroughs often see faster results due to lower competition. We report monthly so you see progress from the start.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does SEO cost for a dental or medical practice?",
    a: "Our healthcare SEO retainers start at $3,500 per month and include Google Business Profile optimization, citation building across healthcare directories, patient-focused content creation, neighborhood-targeted landing pages, review generation systems, and monthly reporting. Project-based work like a complete website redesign with SEO architecture starts at $2,500. We also offer consulting at $150 per hour for practices with in-house marketing teams who need expert SEO guidance.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you handle HIPAA compliance in healthcare SEO content?",
    a: "Yes. Every piece of content we create for healthcare clients adheres to HIPAA guidelines. We never include patient-identifiable information, real patient stories without documented consent, or any content that could constitute a privacy violation. Our content focuses on conditions, treatments, provider credentials, and practice differentiators — all of which are safe to publish. We also advise on review response best practices to ensure your replies never confirm or deny a patient relationship.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you help a healthcare practice rank on Zocdoc and Healthgrades?",
    a: "While we do not manage Zocdoc or Healthgrades accounts directly (those are paid platforms with their own internal ranking algorithms), we optimize your profiles on every healthcare directory as part of our citation strategy. Complete, accurate profiles with consistent NAP data, comprehensive specialty listings, and patient reviews improve your visibility on these platforms. More importantly, the SEO work we do — local authority, content depth, review velocity — helps you rank organically so patients find you directly on Google instead of through a middleman that takes a cut.",
  },
  {
    q: "What makes healthcare SEO different from other industries?",
    a: "Healthcare SEO has unique challenges: HIPAA content restrictions, YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) quality standards from Google that demand authoritative content, complex insurance and credential verification signals, and a patient population that researches extensively before booking. Google holds healthcare content to higher E-E-A-T standards — Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness — which means thin content and generic blog posts actively hurt your rankings. We build content that demonstrates clinical expertise while remaining accessible to patients.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you optimize for telehealth and virtual practice searches?",
    a: "Yes. Telehealth search volume has grown significantly since 2020 and remains a major patient acquisition channel. We optimize for telehealth-specific keywords — 'online therapist NYC,' 'virtual dermatology consultation,' 'telehealth psychiatrist New York' — and create dedicated telehealth service pages that target these queries. We also optimize your Google Business Profile to reflect telehealth availability, which is a ranking factor for virtual care searches.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do patient reviews impact healthcare SEO rankings?",
    a: "Patient reviews are one of the top three ranking factors for the Google Maps local pack. Healthcare practices with more reviews, higher ratings, and recent review activity consistently outrank competitors. In competitive NYC markets, the practices ranking in the local pack typically have 100+ Google reviews with 4.5+ star averages. We implement HIPAA-compliant review generation systems — automated post-appointment emails, SMS requests, and in-office prompts — that systematically grow your review count without violating patient privacy regulations.",

            Why Healthcare Practices in NYC Need SEO

          <div className="mt-8 space-y-6 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              NYC has over 65,000 licensed physicians and thousands more dentists, therapists, chiropractors, and wellness practitioners all competing for the same patient population. The practices that thrive are not necessarily the best clinicians — they are the most visible ones. When a patient searches &ldquo;dentist accepting new patients near me&rdquo; or &ldquo;best dermatologist Manhattan,&rdquo; the{" "}
              <Link href="/services/google-business-profile" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">Google Business Profile</Link>{" "}
              and organic listings on the first page capture 95% of the clicks. Page two might as well not exist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Healthcare is a YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) category in Google&rsquo;s quality guidelines, which means Google holds medical content to the highest standards of{" "}
              <Link href="/services/content-marketing" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">content quality</Link>{" "}
              and authority. Generic blog posts about &ldquo;5 tips for healthy teeth&rdquo; written by freelancers do not rank anymore. Google wants content written or reviewed by credentialed professionals, published on authoritative websites, and backed by consistent patient reviews and professional citations. This is exactly what our{" "}
              <Link href="/services/seo-strategy" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">SEO strategy</Link>{" "}
              delivers for healthcare practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              The shift to AI search makes this even more critical. When a patient asks ChatGPT &ldquo;who is the best chiropractor in Park Slope,&rdquo; the answer is synthesized from the same signals that drive Google rankings: consistent business data, authoritative content, patient reviews, and structured data markup. Practices that invest in{" "}
              <Link href="/services/ai-search-optimization" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">AI search optimization</Link>{" "}
              today are building the patient pipeline that will dominate for the next decade. Those that ignore it will watch their competitors get recommended while they remain invisible.

const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What analytics platforms do you use for SEO reporting?",
    a: "We use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) as the primary web analytics platform, Google Search Console for organic search performance data, and Full Loop CRM for lead attribution and revenue tracking. For keyword rank tracking, we monitor positions across Google, Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo daily. For AI search visibility, we use proprietary monitoring tools that track when and how ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude mention your business. Core Web Vitals are monitored through a combination of PageSpeed Insights, Chrome UX Report data, and real user monitoring. Every data source feeds into a unified real-time dashboard you can access anytime.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much do SEO analytics and reporting services cost in NYC?",
    a: "Our standalone analytics and reporting services start at $1,500 per month for single-location businesses and scale to $5,000 per month for multi-location operations with complex tracking requirements. Most of our clients include analytics as part of a full SEO campaign — our Foundation tier starts at $3,500 per month, Growth at $7,500 per month, and Domination at $15,000+ per month, all of which include comprehensive analytics and reporting. Every dollar is tied to measurable outcomes — we do not bill for dashboards that sit unread.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between vanity metrics and revenue metrics?",
    a: "Vanity metrics are numbers that look impressive but do not connect to revenue — total page views, social media impressions, raw traffic numbers, and keyword count. Revenue metrics track outcomes that directly impact your bottom line — phone calls attributed to specific pages, form submissions by keyword, conversion rates by landing page, cost per lead by channel, and revenue generated per organic visit. We report both, but our dashboards lead with revenue metrics because that is what actually matters to your business. A page with 10,000 visits and zero calls is a failure. A page with 200 visits and 40 calls is a winner.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you track AI search visibility across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini?",
    a: "We run regular queries across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude that mirror what your potential customers would ask — questions like 'best plumber in Brooklyn' or 'who should I hire for HVAC repair in Queens.' We track whether your business is mentioned, how prominently it appears, what context surrounds the mention, and how the recommendations change over time. This data feeds into your monthly report alongside traditional ranking data. AI search visibility is still a frontier — most agencies do not track it at all. We have been monitoring it since these platforms launched and have proprietary benchmarks for over 170 service categories across 318 NYC neighborhoods.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I get access to a real-time dashboard or just monthly PDFs?",
    a: "Both. You get a real-time dashboard powered by Full Loop CRM that you can check anytime — keyword rankings, traffic trends, lead counts, call logs, form submissions, and conversion rates are all updated continuously. You also receive a comprehensive monthly report delivered as a recorded video walkthrough where we explain what happened, what it means, and what we are doing next. The PDF-only model is dead — you should never have to wait 30 days to see how your marketing is performing.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is call tracking and how does it work for SEO?",
    a: "Call tracking uses unique phone numbers on your website and Google Business Profile to attribute every incoming call to its source — which page the caller visited, which keyword brought them there, which search engine they came from, and how long the call lasted. We use Telnyx for call tracking infrastructure because it provides carrier-grade reliability and detailed call metadata. Every call is logged in Full Loop CRM with the source data attached, so you can see exactly which SEO efforts are generating phone calls and which need adjustment. This is how you know whether your investment in local SEO is actually driving revenue.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you track form submissions and attribute them to SEO?",
    a: "Every form submission on your website is captured with full attribution data — the page the visitor was on when they submitted, the keyword that brought them to your site, the search engine they used, whether they were a new or returning visitor, and their geographic location. We track this through a combination of GA4 event tracking, UTM parameters, and Full Loop CRM form integration. No submission slips through the cracks. You can see every lead, trace it back to the exact page and keyword that generated it, and calculate your true cost per lead from organic search.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are Core Web Vitals and why do you monitor them?",
    a: "Core Web Vitals are Google's metrics for measuring user experience — Largest Contentful Paint (how fast your main content loads), Interaction to Next Paint (how quickly the page responds to user input), and Cumulative Layout Shift (how stable the layout is as the page loads). Google uses these as ranking factors, meaning poor Core Web Vitals directly hurt your search rankings. We monitor them continuously because performance degrades over time — new images, third-party scripts, and content changes can all slow your site down. When a metric drops below threshold, we fix it before it impacts your rankings. Every site we build on Next.js scores 95+ on PageSpeed Insights, but even high-performing sites need ongoing monitoring.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often do you report on SEO performance?",
    a: "You have real-time access to your dashboard 24/7. Formal reports are delivered monthly and include a recorded video walkthrough. For clients on Growth and Domination tiers, we also provide bi-weekly or weekly check-ins where we review performance data and adjust strategy in real time. If something significant happens — a major ranking change, a traffic spike or drop, a Core Web Vitals issue — we notify you immediately and explain what happened and what we are doing about it. You should never be surprised by your own analytics.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you set up analytics for a website you did not build?",
    a: "Yes. We set up and configure Google Analytics 4, Google Search Console, call tracking, form tracking, and conversion events on any website regardless of platform. However, we strongly recommend migrating to Next.js for the best possible tracking accuracy and site performance. WordPress sites often have plugin conflicts that interfere with tracking scripts, slow page loads that cause data loss, and caching issues that make analytics unreliable. We have set up analytics on WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, Shopify, and custom-built sites — but the cleanest data always comes from sites we build ourselves.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is conversion rate optimization and how does it relate to analytics?",
    a: "Conversion rate optimization (CRO) uses analytics data to improve the percentage of visitors who take a desired action — calling you, filling out a form, or booking an appointment. Analytics tells us which pages have high traffic but low conversions, which calls-to-action get clicked and which get ignored, and where visitors drop off before converting. We then test changes — different headlines, button placements, form lengths, page layouts — and measure the impact. A 1% improvement in conversion rate on a page that gets 1,000 visits per month means 10 additional leads per month without spending a dollar on additional traffic. CRO is where analytics becomes action.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you track rankings across multiple search engines or just Google?",
    a: "We track keyword rankings across Google, Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo — plus AI search platforms including ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude. Google dominates market share, but Bing powers a significant portion of voice search and is the default search engine for Microsoft Edge users. DuckDuckGo has grown substantially among privacy-conscious users. Yahoo still captures meaningful search volume. And AI search platforms are the fastest-growing discovery channel since mobile. Tracking only Google means you are blind to 20-30% of your potential search visibility.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you measure the ROI of SEO specifically?",
    a: "We calculate SEO ROI by tracking every lead generated through organic search — phone calls, form submissions, and AI agent interactions — and comparing the revenue those leads generate against the cost of your SEO campaign. Using Full Loop CRM, we can attribute specific customers and revenue back to the exact keyword, page, and search engine that drove them to your site. If your SEO campaign costs $3,500 per month and generates 40 qualified leads that close at a 25% rate with an average job value of $2,000, your monthly revenue from SEO is $20,000 — a 5.7x return. We track this monthly so you always know exactly what your SEO investment is producing.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if my rankings drop — will I see it in the dashboard?",
    a: "Yes, immediately. Our rank tracking updates daily, so any significant position changes appear in your dashboard within 24 hours. If a critical keyword drops out of the top 10, we are alerted automatically and begin investigating before you even notice. Common causes include algorithm updates, competitor activity, technical issues, or content changes. We diagnose the cause, implement fixes, and report back to you with a clear explanation of what happened and what we did about it. This is why continuous monitoring matters — the faster you catch a problem, the faster you fix it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can analytics help me decide which services or areas to expand into?",
    a: "Absolutely. Analytics data reveals which keywords have high search volume but low competition — these are expansion opportunities. We can show you which neighborhoods are searching for your services but finding no relevant results, which service categories have growing demand in your area, and which competitor gaps you can exploit. This data directly informs your SEO strategy, content calendar, and business development decisions. Some of our clients have opened new service lines or expanded into new boroughs based entirely on what the search data told us.",

              We built our analytics practice around one principle: every metric must connect to a lead or a dollar. If a number does not help you make a better business decision, it does not belong in your report. This is why our dashboards lead with revenue metrics — calls, form submissions, conversion rates, cost per lead, and revenue per keyword — not impressions, page views, or bounce rates. Whether you are a{" "}

              In 2026, the analytics landscape is more complex than ever. Your customers are finding you through Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, Google Maps, voice search on Alexa and Siri, and dozens of other channels. Whether they are searching from{" "}

Most businesses have broken or misconfigured tracking: GA4 events that do not fire, Search Console properties that are not verified, missing call tracking numbers, and form submissions that are not captured. We identify every gap, fix what is broken, and deploy a comprehensive tracking stack. This includes GA4 with custom event tracking, Google Search Console verification and configuration, Telnyx-powered call tracking with unique numbers per traffic source, form submission tracking with full attribution, and Full Loop CRM integration for unified lead management. Whether your site needs a full technical audit or a complete rebuild, the infrastructure we deploy captures every interaction a potential customer has with your business online.",

We also configure AI search visibility monitoring across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude, tracking when your business is mentioned, how prominently it appears, and which queries trigger recommendations. Position tracking is not just about knowing where you rank — it is about understanding movement patterns, identifying opportunities, and catching drops before they cost you leads.",

We connect this data to Full Loop CRM so every lead has a complete attribution trail from first click to closed deal. When you ask 'which keywords are generating revenue,' we can answer with exact numbers, not estimates. When you ask 'which pages are wasting traffic,' we can tell you precisely which ones have high visits and zero conversions.",

We highlight wins so you understand what is working. We flag concerns so you know what we are monitoring. And we outline next steps so you understand exactly where your investment is going.

When an alert fires, we investigate immediately, diagnose the cause, implement a fix, and notify you with a clear explanation. We also use analytics data to drive ongoing optimization decisions: if a page is ranking well but converting poorly, we test new calls-to-action. If a keyword is generating traffic but not leads, we audit the landing page. If AI search mentions are declining, we adjust your structured data and content strategy.

            We use enterprise-grade tools — not WordPress plugins, not free tier dashboards, not cobbled-together spreadsheets. Every tool in our stack is chosen for reliability, accuracy, and integration capabilities.

              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                GA4 is the foundation of our web analytics setup. We configure custom events for every conversion action, set up enhanced measurement for scroll depth and file downloads, implement cross-domain tracking where needed, and build custom reports that surface the metrics that matter to your business. GA4 replaced Universal Analytics in 2023, and most businesses still have not configured it properly — broken event tracking, missing conversion goals, and incorrect attribution models are epidemic. We fix all of this during setup and validate tracking accuracy before declaring the infrastructure live.

              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                Search Console is the only source of truth for how Google sees your website. We monitor organic clicks, impressions, click-through rates, and average positions for every query and page. We track index coverage to ensure every page that should be indexed is indexed and every page that should not be is excluded. We monitor Core Web Vitals from Chrome User Experience Report data, review mobile usability issues, and set up alerts for manual actions and security problems. For businesses with{" "}

                is the unified dashboard that ties everything together. It integrates with GA4, Search Console, our call tracking system, and form submissions to provide a single source of truth for lead attribution and revenue tracking. Every lead that enters the system is tagged with its source — which keyword, which page, which search engine, which device — and tracked through the sales pipeline to closed deal. This is how we calculate true SEO ROI: not theoretical value based on traffic estimates, but actual revenue attributed to organic search performance. Full Loop CRM also powers the real-time dashboards our clients access directly.

                We use Telnyx for call tracking because it provides carrier-grade reliability, number portability, and detailed call metadata that consumer-grade solutions cannot match. Every traffic source gets its own tracking number — one for organic Google traffic, one for Bing, one for{" "}

const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Can SEO help real estate agents compete with Zillow and StreetEasy?",
    a: "Yes, and here is how. You will never outrank Zillow for 'apartments for sale NYC,' nor should you try. But Zillow cannot compete with you on hyperlocal expertise. We target searches like 'best real estate agent in Park Slope,' 'co-op specialist Upper West Side,' or 'property manager Astoria' -- terms where local expertise wins and Zillow is just an aggregator. That is where your listings and your reputation close deals.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does SEO take for a real estate business?",
    a: "Real estate SEO typically delivers visible ranking improvements within 3-5 months, with meaningful lead generation by month 6-8. Hyperlocal terms like 'real estate agent [neighborhood]' rank faster than broader terms. We build neighborhood-specific pages, market report content, and local authority signals that compound over time -- each month stronger than the last.",
  },
  {
    q: "What SEO services matter most for real estate professionals?",
    a: "Local SEO and Google Business Profile optimization are the foundation. Over 90% of home buyers and sellers start online, and most search by neighborhood. We optimize your GBP, build neighborhood landing pages, create market report content, generate reviews, and ensure you dominate the local pack for every area you serve.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does SEO cost for real estate businesses?",
    a: "Monthly retainers start at $3,500/month, covering local SEO, content marketing, GBP management, and AI search optimization. One-time projects like website redesigns start at $2,500. Consulting is available at $150/hour. Given that a single real estate commission in NYC can exceed $20,000, the ROI math on SEO is straightforward.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should property managers invest in SEO?",
    a: "Absolutely. Landlords and building owners search 'property management company [borough]' and 'best property manager NYC' when they need management services. Tenants search 'apartments for rent [neighborhood]' and often reach the managing company's site. SEO positions you to capture both sides of the market -- new management contracts and tenant leads for your existing portfolio.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does AI search optimization work for real estate?",
    a: "When a buyer asks ChatGPT 'best real estate agents in Brooklyn Heights' or a landlord asks Perplexity 'top property management companies NYC,' AI pulls from well-structured, authoritative web content. We optimize your site's entity signals, content structure, and authority markers so AI platforms cite your business in these high-value queries.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you create neighborhood-specific pages for each area we serve?",
    a: "Yes. Each neighborhood you serve gets a dedicated, SEO-optimized page covering local market data, your expertise in that area, recent transactions, and neighborhood-specific content. A real estate agent serving 15 neighborhoods should have 15 neighborhood pages -- each targeting the exact searches buyers and sellers in that area perform.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can SEO help home inspectors and appraisers get more business?",
    a: "Home inspectors and appraisers rely heavily on referrals from agents, but SEO opens a direct channel to consumers. Buyers increasingly search 'home inspector near me' or 'property appraiser [borough]' independently. Ranking for these terms builds a pipeline that does not depend entirely on agent relationships.",

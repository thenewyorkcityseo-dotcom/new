    {
      q: "How much does SEO cost for a restaurant in NYC?",
      a: "SEO retainers for restaurants and food businesses start at $3,500/month, covering local SEO, Google Business Profile optimization, content marketing, on-page SEO, and AI search optimization. Project-based work like website builds or GBP optimization starts at $2,500. The investment depends on your competitive landscape, number of locations, and whether you're targeting delivery, dine-in, catering, or all three. A single-location bakery needs less than a multi-location restaurant group.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long until my restaurant ranks on Google in NYC?",
      a: "Most restaurants see measurable ranking improvements in 60-90 days, with significant gains in 4-6 months. Google Business Profile optimizations can impact your Maps ranking within weeks — critical for restaurants since Maps drives a massive share of dining decisions. Competitive neighborhoods like the West Village, Williamsburg, and the Lower East Side take longer. We provide monthly progress reports from day one.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you work with caterers and food trucks or just restaurants?",
      a: "We work with every type of food and dining business: restaurants (all cuisine types), caterers, bakeries, food trucks, ghost kitchens, meal prep services, and specialty food shops. Each business type requires a different keyword strategy because someone searching for a caterer has completely different intent than someone looking for a restaurant nearby.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can you help my restaurant show up on ChatGPT and Perplexity?",
      a: "Yes. AI search optimization is one of our core services. When someone asks ChatGPT 'best Italian restaurant in Park Slope' or 'find a caterer for a corporate event in Midtown,' we structure your content so your business is the one that gets recommended. We build the entity relationships, authority signals, and structured data that AI platforms use to generate answers.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do you handle Google Business Profile for restaurants?",
      a: "We optimize every element: primary and secondary categories (Restaurant, Italian Restaurant, Catering Service, etc.), business description, menu items and pricing, service areas, weekly Google Posts featuring specials and events, Q&A seeding with common dining questions, photo optimization of your food and space, review generation strategy, and review response management. For multi-location restaurants, we manage separate profiles for each.",
    },
    {
      q: "What makes your SEO different from other agencies for restaurants?",
      a: "Three things. First, we build on Next.js, not WordPress, so your site loads fast and scores 95+ on Core Web Vitals — critical for diners searching on their phones. Second, we use programmatic SEO to generate hundreds of neighborhood-specific pages at scale. Third, we optimize for AI search platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity, which are rapidly becoming how people discover restaurants. We also offer Full Loop CRM so catering inquiries actually get followed up on.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you build location pages for food businesses?",
      a: `Yes. We generate optimized landing pages for every neighborhood you serve. A caterer targeting the full NYC metro area gets ${totalNeighborhoods}+ unique pages — each targeting searches like "caterer in Tribeca" or "wedding catering Brooklyn" with original content, schema markup, and internal linking.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Do you help with online ordering and delivery SEO?",
      a: "Yes. We optimize your presence for delivery-related searches, build landing pages targeting 'food delivery [neighborhood]' and '[cuisine] delivery near me' queries, and ensure your Google Business Profile reflects delivery options and service areas. For restaurants relying on third-party platforms, we also build direct-ordering SEO strategies to reduce commission fees.",

This becomes your strategy document." },

Build a Conversion-Ready Website", detail: "We build (or rebuild) your site on Next.js with high-quality food photography, menu pages, online ordering integration, reservation CTAs, catering inquiry forms, and event booking. Mobile-first because 70%+ of restaurant searches happen on phones." },
              { step: "3. Optimize Every Page for Search", detail: "On-page SEO across your entire site — title tags targeting 'Thai restaurant Lower East Side,' Menu schema markup, Recipe schema for signature dishes, internal linking architecture, and image optimization that loads fast without sacrificing food photography quality." },
              { step: "4. Launch Neighborhood Landing Pages", detail: `Programmatic generation of ${totalNeighborhoods}+ neighborhood-specific pages. Each page targets "restaurant in [neighborhood]" or "caterer near [neighborhood]" with unique content, local schema, and internal links to your menu and services.` },
              { step: "5. Dominate Google Maps", detail: "Full Google Business Profile optimization, citation building across 50+ directories (Yelp, OpenTable, Resy, Google, Bing, TripAdvisor), review generation strategy with QR codes and follow-up emails, and geo-grid rank tracking for your neighborhoods." },

Build Authority with Content & Links", detail: "Ongoing content marketing (cuisine guides, seasonal menus, event hosting pages, neighborhood dining guides) and off-page SEO (food blogger outreach, editorial backlinks from Eater, Infatuation, TimeOut, and local press) to build domain authority." },
              { step: "7. Optimize for AI Search", detail: "We structure your content so ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude recommend your restaurant. Restaurant discovery via AI assistants is exploding in 2026 — when someone asks 'best date night restaurant in Brooklyn,' we make sure you are the answer." },
              { step: "8. Measure, Report, Improve", detail: "Monthly reporting on keyword rankings, organic traffic, reservation clicks, delivery orders, catering inquiries, and ROI. Quarterly strategy reviews. You always know what your investment produces and where to double down." },

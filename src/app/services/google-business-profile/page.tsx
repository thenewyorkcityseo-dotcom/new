const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What is Google Business Profile and why does it matter for my NYC business?",
    a: "Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is a free listing that controls how your business appears in Google Maps and the local map pack — the top three business results that appear when someone searches for a service near them. For NYC service businesses, GBP is the single most important local ranking factor. When someone searches 'plumber near me' or 'dentist Midtown Manhattan,' the local pack is the first thing they see — above organic results, above ads in many cases. If your GBP is not optimized, you are invisible in the highest-converting real estate in local search. Over 42% of local search clicks go to the map pack, and 76% of people who search for a local business visit one within 24 hours.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does Google Business Profile optimization cost?",
    a: "Our standalone GBP optimization and management service ranges from $1,000 to $2,500 per month depending on the number of locations, competition level, and scope of review management and posting cadence. For businesses that need comprehensive local visibility, we recommend our full SEO campaigns starting at $3,500 per month, which include GBP optimization as part of an integrated local SEO strategy. Every dollar goes directly into optimization, content creation, review management, and performance tracking — no fluff, no vanity metrics.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to rank in the Google Maps 3-pack?",
    a: "Most businesses see measurable improvements in map pack visibility within 60 to 90 days of full GBP optimization. However, breaking into the top 3 in highly competitive NYC markets — personal injury law, HVAC, plumbing — can take 3 to 6 months depending on your starting point, review count, and the strength of your competitors. The key factors are GBP completeness, review volume and velocity, NAP consistency, and proximity to the searcher. We focus on the factors you can control and build momentum month over month.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Google local pack (3-pack) and how do I get into it?",
    a: "The local pack — also called the Google 3-pack or map pack — is the box of three business listings that appears at the top of Google search results for local queries, accompanied by a map. Getting into the 3-pack requires a combination of GBP optimization (complete profile, correct categories, regular posts), review quantity and quality, NAP consistency across the web, local citation signals, on-site SEO signals from your website, and behavioral signals like clicks and calls from your listing. We optimize all of these factors systematically.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do reviews affect my Google Business Profile ranking?",
    a: "Reviews are one of the top three ranking factors for the local map pack. Google considers your total review count, average star rating, review velocity (how frequently you receive new reviews), and the content of reviews — especially when reviewers mention your services and location naturally. Responding to every review — positive and negative — also sends ranking signals. Our review management strategy uses Full Loop CRM to automate feedback collection, encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews, and ensure you respond to every review promptly and professionally.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are Google Posts and should I be using them?",
    a: "Google Posts are short updates that appear directly on your Google Business Profile listing. They can include text, images, videos, CTAs, and links. Posting regularly signals to Google that your business is active and engaged, which contributes to local ranking. We publish 4 to 8 Google Posts per month for each client covering promotions, seasonal tips, before-and-after project highlights, and company news. Each post is optimized with relevant keywords and a clear call-to-action. Posts expire after 7 days, so consistency is critical.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is NAP consistency and why does it matter?",
    a: "NAP stands for Name, Address, Phone number. NAP consistency means your business name, address, and phone number are identical across every listing on the internet — your website, Google Business Profile, Yelp, Facebook, industry directories, BBB, and dozens of other platforms. Inconsistent NAP data confuses Google and dilutes your local ranking signals. Even small differences — '150 W 47th St' versus '150 West 47th Street' — can hurt you. We audit every citation, correct inconsistencies, and build new citations on authoritative directories to strengthen your NAP signals.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you manage multiple Google Business Profile locations?",
    a: "Yes. We manage multi-location GBP strategies for businesses with two to twenty-plus locations across the NYC metro area. Each location gets its own optimized profile with location-specific descriptions, categories, photos, posts, and review management. We ensure each listing targets the right service area without cannibalizing the others, and we use a centralized dashboard to monitor all locations simultaneously. Multi-location management starts at $2,000 per month plus $500 per additional location.",
  },
  {
    q: "What GBP categories should I choose for my business?",
    a: "Choosing the right primary and secondary categories is one of the most impactful things you can do for your GBP ranking. Your primary category should be the most specific term that describes your core service — 'Emergency Plumber' ranks differently than 'Plumber,' and 'Personal Injury Attorney' ranks differently than 'Lawyer.' You can add up to 10 secondary categories. We research which categories your top-ranking competitors use, which categories drive the most visibility for your services, and which combinations produce the best results in your specific market.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I handle negative reviews on Google?",
    a: "Negative reviews happen to every business. The key is how you respond. We craft professional, empathetic responses to every negative review within 24 hours. We address the customer's concern specifically, offer to resolve the issue offline, and demonstrate to future readers that you take customer satisfaction seriously. Google does not remove legitimate negative reviews, but a professional response can actually increase trust — 45% of consumers say they are more likely to visit a business that responds to negative reviews. If a review violates Google's policies — fake, spam, or from someone who was never a customer — we flag it for removal.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between GBP optimization and local SEO?",
    a: "GBP optimization is one component of local SEO. Local SEO encompasses everything that affects your visibility in local search — Google Business Profile, local citations, on-site location pages, local link building, review management, and localized content. GBP optimization focuses specifically on your Google Business Profile listing — categories, description, photos, posts, Q&A, reviews, and attributes. For maximum local visibility, you need both. Our standalone GBP service is ideal for businesses that already have a strong website. Our full SEO campaigns include GBP optimization plus website optimization, citation building, and content creation.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do GBP attributes and service areas work?",
    a: "GBP attributes are checkboxes that describe your business — things like 'women-owned,' 'veteran-owned,' 'wheelchair accessible,' 'free estimates,' or 'emergency service available.' These attributes appear on your listing and can influence which searches your profile appears for. Service areas define the geographic regions you serve. For service-area businesses that travel to customers — plumbers, electricians, cleaners — you set service areas instead of (or in addition to) a physical address. We configure both attributes and service areas strategically to maximize your visibility for the searches that matter most.",
  },
  {
    q: "What photos should I add to my Google Business Profile?",
    a: "Businesses with photos receive 42% more requests for directions and 35% more click-throughs to their websites. We optimize your GBP with high-quality photos across every category Google supports — logo, cover photo, exterior, interior, team members, at-work photos, and before-and-after project images. Each photo is geotagged with your business location metadata, properly sized, and labeled with descriptive filenames. We recommend uploading 3 to 5 new photos per month to signal freshness and activity to Google's algorithm.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you help with Google Business Profile Q&A?",
    a: "Yes. The Q&A section of your GBP is an often-overlooked ranking opportunity. Anyone can ask or answer questions on your listing — including you. We proactively seed your Q&A section with common questions your customers ask, provide detailed answers that include relevant keywords naturally, and monitor for new questions so we can respond quickly. This section also feeds AI search platforms with structured question-and-answer data about your business.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is GBP Insights and how do you use it?",
    a: "GBP Insights (now part of Google Business Profile Performance) tracks how customers find and interact with your listing — search queries used, direct versus discovery searches, phone calls, direction requests, website clicks, photo views, and more. We analyze this data monthly to identify which searches drive the most engagement, which photos perform best, which posts generate the most clicks, and where there are opportunities to improve. This data directly informs our optimization strategy and is included in your monthly report.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you help me set up a new Google Business Profile from scratch?",
    a: "Absolutely. We handle the entire GBP setup process — creating the listing, verifying the business (including video verification if required), writing an optimized business description, selecting primary and secondary categories, configuring service areas, adding attributes, uploading photos, setting business hours, adding services and products, writing initial posts, seeding the Q&A section, and connecting your appointment booking link. Most new GBP setups are live and fully optimized within 7 to 14 days.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does Full Loop CRM help with review management?",
    a: "Full Loop CRM is our integrated customer relationship management platform that automates the review collection process. After a service is completed, Full Loop automatically sends a feedback request to the customer. Satisfied customers are directed to leave a review on Google. Customers with concerns are routed to an internal feedback form so you can address issues before they become public reviews. This automated system increases review volume by 3x to 5x compared to manual review requests, and it filters negative experiences before they hit your public profile.",

            <p>
              Google Business Profile — formerly known as Google My Business — is the free listing that controls how your business appears in Google Maps and the local map pack. When someone in{" "}
              <Link href="/plumber/upper-east-side" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">the Upper East Side</Link>{" "}

              searches &ldquo;electrician Brooklyn,&rdquo; the first thing they see is the local 3-pack — three business listings with star ratings, phone numbers, hours, and a click-to-call button, all sitting above the organic search results. That 3-pack is powered entirely by Google Business Profile. If your GBP is not optimized, you are invisible in the most valuable real estate in local search.
            </p>
            <p>
              The numbers tell the story. Over 42% of all clicks on local search results go to the map pack. 76% of people who perform a local search on their phone visit a physical location within 24 hours. 28% of those searches result in a purchase. And according to Google&apos;s own data, businesses with complete GBP listings are 70% more likely to attract location visits and 50% more likely to lead to a purchase.

              Google uses three primary factors to determine local map pack rankings: relevance (how well your profile matches the search query), distance (how close you are to the searcher), and prominence (how well-known and trusted your business is online). Prominence is where optimization matters most — it encompasses your review count and ratings, your{" "}
              <Link href="/services/seo" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">website SEO signals</Link>, your citation consistency, the quality of your GBP content, and your overall online authority. Every aspect of our GBP optimization service is designed to maximize your prominence signals so Google ranks you above your competitors in the map pack.
            </p>
            <p>
              And here is what most businesses miss: your GBP does not exist in isolation. It works in concert with your{" "}
              <Link href="/services/seo" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">organic SEO</Link>, your{" "}

Google connects signals across all of these channels. A strong GBP with a weak website will not rank. A great website with a neglected GBP will not appear in Maps. We optimize the entire ecosystem — not just one piece of it.

We analyze their category selections, review counts and velocity, posting cadence, photo quality, Q&A sections, and citation profiles. We cross-reference your NAP data across 80+ directories to identify inconsistencies. We check your GBP Insights data to understand how customers are currently finding and interacting with your listing. This audit typically takes 8 to 12 hours and produces a detailed gap analysis that becomes the foundation of your entire optimization strategy.

'Personal Injury Attorney' ranks differently than 'Lawyer.' We research which primary and secondary categories drive the most visibility in your specific market. Then we write a keyword-rich business description that reads naturally while targeting your top search queries. We configure your service areas strategically, add every relevant attribute, set up appointment links, add your services with descriptions and pricing, configure business hours and special hours, and ensure your profile is 100% complete.

This system typically increases review volume by 3x to 5x within the first 90 days.

Each answer is detailed, keyword-rich, and written to serve both human readers and search engines.

          <p className="mt-4 text-zinc-400">
            Every marketing channel has trade-offs. Here is how a fully optimized Google Business Profile compares to the alternatives NYC service businesses typically consider.

              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                Google Ads puts you at the top of the page immediately, but you pay $15 to $85 per click for service keywords in NYC — and the moment you stop paying, you disappear. A fully optimized GBP gets you into the local 3-pack, which appears above organic results and often receives more clicks than ads because consumers trust map pack results more. GBP clicks are free. Once you rank in the map pack, every call, every direction request, and every website click costs you nothing. Over a 12-month period, GBP optimization delivers 8x to 15x better ROI than PPC for local service businesses. The smartest approach is to run{" "}

              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                Lead aggregators charge $30 to $100+ per lead, share those leads with 3 to 5 competitors, and give you zero control over lead quality or customer experience. Your Google Business Profile is yours. When a customer finds you in the map pack, they see your reviews, your photos, your posts, your hours — and they call you directly. No shared leads. No middleman. No per-lead fees. The leads from GBP are also higher quality because the customer has already evaluated your profile, read your reviews, and decided you are the right fit before they pick up the phone. Yelp and Angi have their place, but GBP should always be your primary local visibility channel.

                gets you into the traditional &ldquo;10 blue links&rdquo; below the map pack. GBP optimization gets you into the map pack itself — which appears first, includes your star rating, and has a click-to-call button. You need both. Organic SEO signals (your website, backlinks, content) directly influence your GBP rankings, and your GBP signals (reviews, categories, NAP consistency) influence your organic rankings. They are not separate strategies — they are two halves of the same local search strategy. Businesses that optimize both see 3x to 5x more total local search traffic than businesses that focus on only one.

              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                If you have not touched your GBP, you are actively losing money. An unclaimed or unoptimized profile means you are invisible in Maps for 42% of local search clicks. Your competitors with 50+ reviews are getting the calls that should be yours. Your missing photos, blank description, and wrong categories are telling Google — and customers — that your business is not worth ranking. Every month you delay GBP optimization is a month of lost leads, lost revenue, and lost ground to competitors who are investing in their local presence. The businesses that dominate the map pack today are not smarter than you — they just started optimizing sooner.

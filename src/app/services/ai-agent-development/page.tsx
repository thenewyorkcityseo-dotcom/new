const faqs = [
  {
    q: "How much does custom AI agent development cost?",
    a: "Our AI agent projects range from $7,500 to $30,000+ depending on complexity, integrations, and scope. A single-channel chatbot with FAQ handling and lead capture starts around $7,500. A multi-channel system with voice agents, SMS automation, CRM integration, bilingual support, and custom knowledge bases runs $15,000 to $30,000+. Monthly maintenance and optimization plans are available starting at $1,500 per month. Every project includes training, deployment, and 30 days of post-launch support.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is an AI agent and how is it different from a regular chatbot?",
    a: "A regular chatbot follows pre-written scripts — if someone asks something outside the script, it breaks. An AI agent uses large language models to understand context, handle complex conversations, and take real actions — booking appointments, qualifying leads, looking up pricing, transferring calls, and sending follow-up messages. Our AI agents are trained on your actual business data: your services, pricing, service areas, FAQs, and scheduling availability. They do not just answer questions — they close leads.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to build and deploy a custom AI agent?",
    a: "Most AI agent projects take 3 to 6 weeks from kickoff to deployment. Simple chatbot agents with FAQ handling can be live in 2 weeks. Complex multi-channel systems with voice agents, CRM integration, and custom knowledge bases take 4 to 8 weeks. We handle the entire process — knowledge base creation, conversation flow design, integration setup, testing, and deployment. You do not need any technical expertise on your end.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can AI agents really handle phone calls?",
    a: "Yes. Our voice AI agents use Telnyx telephony infrastructure to answer phone calls with natural-sounding conversation — not robotic IVR menus. They handle common questions, capture caller information, book appointments, provide business hours and pricing, and escalate urgent or complex calls to your team in real-time. Every call is logged, transcribed, and stored in your CRM. Voice agents are particularly valuable for service businesses that miss 40 to 60 percent of incoming calls during busy hours.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do your AI agents work in Spanish?",
    a: "Yes. All of our AI agents are built with full bilingual support — English and Spanish — out of the box. The agent automatically detects the language the customer is using and responds accordingly. This is critical for NYC service businesses where a significant portion of your customer base communicates in Spanish. Our AI agents handle both languages with equal fluency across chat, SMS, and voice channels.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do AI agents use our SEO data?",
    a: "This is what separates our approach from generic chatbot builders. Your SEO strategy already produces structured data about your services, service areas, pricing, FAQs, and competitive positioning. We use that same data to build your AI agent's knowledge base. When a customer asks your chatbot about drain cleaning in Park Slope, the agent pulls from the same structured content that ranks your drain cleaning page in Google. Your SEO and your AI agent reinforce each other — the data that drives rankings also drives conversions.",
  },
  {
    q: "What platforms and channels do your AI agents support?",
    a: "Our AI agents deploy across every channel your customers use: website chat widgets, SMS text messaging via Telnyx, voice phone calls, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Instagram DMs, and email. Most of our service business clients start with website chat plus SMS, then add voice agents as a second phase. All channels feed into a single conversation history so your team always has full context, regardless of how the customer reached you.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is Selenas and how does it relate to your AI agent work?",
    a: "Selenas is the AI sales assistant built into Full Loop CRM — our proprietary CRM platform at fullloopcrm.com. Selenas handles approximately 80 percent of receptionist duties: answering questions, qualifying leads, booking appointments, sending follow-ups, and managing customer conversations via SMS, all 24/7 in both English and Spanish. We built Selenas ourselves, and the same team that built it builds custom AI agents for our clients. Selenas is a real-world, production-tested example of exactly what we deliver.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to change my existing website or CRM to use AI agents?",
    a: "No. Our AI agents integrate with your existing systems. We embed chat widgets on any website regardless of the platform. We connect to your existing CRM, calendar, and booking systems via API. If you are using Full Loop CRM, the integration is native and seamless. If you are on another platform — HubSpot, Salesforce, GoHighLevel, or any system with an API — we build custom integrations. You do not need to replace anything.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens when an AI agent cannot answer a question?",
    a: "Every AI agent we build includes intelligent escalation logic. When a question falls outside the agent's knowledge base, is too complex for automated handling, or when the customer explicitly asks for a human, the agent seamlessly transfers the conversation to your team — via live chat handoff, phone transfer, SMS alert, or email notification, depending on your preference. The agent also logs the question so we can expand the knowledge base to handle it next time. Over time, the agent gets smarter and handles more conversations end-to-end.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you measure the ROI of an AI agent?",
    a: "We track every metric that matters: total conversations handled, leads captured, appointments booked, after-hours leads that would have been lost, average response time versus your previous response time, qualification accuracy, and escalation rate. Most of our clients see full ROI within 60 to 90 days based on leads captured after hours alone. A single lead for a personal injury lawyer, plumber emergency call, or dental patient is often worth $500 to $5,000+ — one after-hours lead per week pays for the entire system.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are AI agents secure? What about customer data privacy?",
    a: "Security is built into every layer of our AI agent architecture. We use Supabase for data storage — enterprise-grade PostgreSQL with row-level security, encryption at rest, and SOC 2 compliance. All conversations are encrypted in transit via TLS. We never share customer data with third parties or use it to train external models. Our agents run on dedicated infrastructure, not shared public chatbot platforms. For businesses with specific compliance requirements — HIPAA, PCI, or industry-specific regulations — we build custom security configurations.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can AI agents book appointments directly into my calendar?",
    a: "Yes. Our AI agents integrate directly with Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, Calendly, Acuity, and custom booking systems. The agent checks real-time availability, offers time slots to the customer, confirms the booking, sends confirmation messages via SMS or email, and adds the appointment to your calendar — all within a single conversation. No human intervention required. For service businesses that rely on appointment scheduling, this alone justifies the investment.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer ongoing maintenance and optimization after launch?",
    a: "Yes. We offer monthly maintenance plans starting at $1,500 per month that include knowledge base updates, conversation flow optimization, performance monitoring, analytics reporting, and priority support. AI agents improve over time — we analyze conversation logs, identify patterns, expand the knowledge base, tune responses, and add new capabilities as your business evolves. Most clients on maintenance plans see a 20 to 30 percent improvement in agent performance within the first 90 days post-launch.",
  },
  {
    q: "What industries benefit most from AI agents?",
    a: "Any service business that handles inbound inquiries benefits from AI agents, but the highest-ROI industries are those with high lead values and high call volumes: personal injury lawyers, dentists, HVAC contractors, plumbers, electricians, medical practices, home remodelers, and real estate professionals. If you receive more than 20 inbound inquiries per week and your average customer value exceeds $500, an AI agent will almost certainly pay for itself within the first quarter.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is The NYC SEO different from other AI agent developers?",
    a: "Three things set us apart. First, we are an SEO agency — we build AI agents powered by the same structured data that drives your search rankings. No other AI developer connects these two systems. Second, we have a production-proven AI platform — Selenas, the AI assistant inside Full Loop CRM, handles thousands of real conversations monthly. We are not experimenting; we are deploying battle-tested technology. Third, we build on real infrastructure — Supabase, Telnyx, Next.js — not drag-and-drop chatbot builders that break under load. Our agents scale.",

            <p>
              An AI agent is a software system powered by large language models that can understand natural language, hold intelligent conversations, and take real actions on behalf of your business &mdash; booking appointments, qualifying leads, answering questions, processing intake forms, sending follow-up messages, and routing urgent requests to your team. Unlike traditional chatbots that follow rigid, pre-written scripts and break the moment a customer says something unexpected, AI agents understand context, handle nuance, and adapt to the conversation in real time.

              &mdash; the business case is brutally simple. Research shows that 62 percent of calls to service businesses go unanswered. 78 percent of customers hire the first business that responds. Every missed call, every unanswered chat message, every after-hours website visitor who leaves without making contact is a customer who called your competitor instead. An AI agent eliminates that problem entirely.
            </p>
            <p>
              But our AI agents go far beyond just answering the phone. They qualify leads by asking the right questions &mdash; what service do you need, where are you located, what is your timeline, what is your budget. They book appointments directly into your calendar without any human intervention. They handle your most common FAQs with answers pulled from your own{" "}
              <Link href="/services/content-marketing" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">content</Link>{" "}
              and{" "}
              <Link href="/services/on-page-seo" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">on-page SEO</Link>{" "}
              data. They process intake forms for new customers. They send follow-up messages and appointment reminders. They work in English and Spanish. They work across your website, SMS, and phone &mdash; simultaneously. And they never take a day off.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not theoretical. We built Selenas &mdash; the AI sales assistant inside{" "}

              &mdash; and it handles approximately 80 percent of receptionist duties for the businesses that use it. 24/7 bilingual SMS conversations, lead qualification, appointment booking, follow-ups. Selenas is production-tested, battle-hardened, and processing thousands of real conversations every month. The same team that built Selenas builds custom AI agents for our clients. We are not selling you an idea. We are deploying technology we have already proven works.

Selenas handles approximately 80 percent of receptionist duties for the businesses running on Full Loop &mdash; and it does it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in both English and Spanish.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is what Selenas does in production, right now, every single day: answers inbound SMS messages within seconds. Qualifies leads by asking about service needed, location, timeline, and budget. Books appointments directly into the business&apos;s calendar. Sends confirmation messages and day-of reminders. Follows up with leads who went cold. Handles rescheduling requests. Answers FAQs about pricing, service areas, and availability. Escalates complex or urgent conversations to the business owner or team lead. All of this happens automatically, around the clock, without a human touching it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Selenas is not a prototype or a demo. It is a production system processing thousands of real conversations every month. The technology, the conversation design patterns, the integration architecture, the bilingual capabilities, the escalation logic &mdash; everything we learned building and running Selenas goes directly into the custom AI agents we build for clients. When we tell you our AI agents work, we are not speculating. We are showing you something we use ourselves, at scale, in production.
            </p>
            <p>
              The businesses using Selenas through Full Loop CRM report an average 40 percent increase in booked appointments, a 65 percent reduction in missed leads, and response times that dropped from hours to seconds. Those are not projections &mdash; those are measurements from real businesses running real AI agents that we built and maintain.

              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                Supabase provides the backbone for every AI agent we build &mdash; enterprise-grade PostgreSQL for data storage, real-time subscriptions for live conversation updates, row-level security for data isolation between clients, and edge functions for serverless logic. Conversation histories, customer profiles, knowledge base content, lead scores, and appointment records all live in Supabase. It is open-source, SOC 2 compliant, and scales to millions of records without performance degradation. We chose Supabase over Firebase specifically because we need the relational power of PostgreSQL for complex AI agent workflows &mdash; join tables, full-text search, and JSONB columns for flexible schema storage.

                Telnyx powers all of our voice and SMS capabilities &mdash; phone number provisioning, voice call handling, SMS messaging, and programmable voice with AI integration. When our AI agent answers a phone call, Telnyx handles the telephony layer &mdash; carrier-grade voice quality, low latency, and global coverage. For SMS-based AI conversations, Telnyx provides reliable message delivery, long-code and short-code support, and compliance with carrier filtering requirements. We chose Telnyx over Twilio because of superior voice quality, lower latency, better pricing, and deeper support for programmable AI voice applications.

Built by the same team that created React Email, Resend delivers messages reliably with beautiful, branded templates. No emails going to spam. No reliance on your personal email server. Professional, consistent communications every time your AI agent triggers an action.

                We do not use Chatfuel, ManyChat, Drift, Intercom, or any consumer-grade chatbot platform. Those tools are fine for basic FAQ bots. They are not sufficient for AI agents that need to qualify leads, book appointments, handle voice calls, process intake forms, and manage bilingual conversations across multiple channels simultaneously. Our agents are custom-built from the ground up on production infrastructure that scales. The same way we build websites on Next.js instead of WordPress because performance matters, we build AI agents on Supabase and Telnyx instead of chatbot builders because reliability matters.

We do not use ManyChat, Chatfuel, or any drag-and-drop chatbot builder. Our agents handle voice calls, SMS conversations, and web chat simultaneously without breaking a sweat. When your HVAC company gets slammed with calls during the first cold snap of the year, your AI agent does not go down. It scales.

              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                In NYC, bilingual is not optional &mdash; it is essential. Every AI agent we build handles English and Spanish natively. Not through translation APIs that produce awkward, stilted responses, but through models that understand both languages fluently and switch between them seamlessly based on what the customer writes or says. For service businesses serving diverse NYC communities, this is the difference between capturing a lead and losing one.

const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What is a fractional marketing manager?",
    a: "A fractional marketing manager is a senior marketing leader who works with your business on a part-time or retainer basis instead of as a full-time employee. You get the strategic thinking, campaign oversight, vendor management, and performance accountability of a marketing director — without the $150,000 to $200,000 annual salary, benefits, equity, and overhead that comes with a full-time hire. Fractional marketing managers typically work with 3 to 5 clients simultaneously, which means you get experienced leadership at a fraction of the cost. For service businesses doing $500K to $10M in revenue, this is the sweet spot — enough marketing complexity to need real leadership, but not enough to justify a full-time executive.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does a fractional marketing manager cost in NYC?",
    a: "Our fractional marketing manager retainers range from $5,000 to $10,000 per month depending on scope, hours, and complexity. The Operator tier at $5,000 per month includes 20 hours of dedicated marketing leadership monthly. The Strategist tier at $7,500 per month includes 30 hours plus vendor and agency management. The full Marketing Director tier at $10,000 per month includes 40+ hours, full-stack marketing leadership, and team coordination. Compare this to a full-time marketing manager salary in NYC — $120,000 to $180,000 per year plus benefits, taxes, equipment, and management overhead. You save 60% to 75% with a fractional model and get more experienced talent.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from hiring a marketing agency?",
    a: "A marketing agency executes specific deliverables — they run your ads, write your content, or manage your SEO. A fractional marketing manager leads your entire marketing function. They set the strategy, manage the agencies, allocate the budget, measure the results, and make sure every channel is working together toward the same business goals. Think of it this way: agencies are the players, and the fractional marketing manager is the coach. Without a coach, your agencies operate in silos, duplicate effort, contradict each other, and waste your budget. We coordinate everything into a unified system that actually drives revenue.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does a fractional marketing manager actually do day-to-day?",
    a: "On a typical week, your fractional marketing manager reviews campaign performance across all channels, coordinates with any agencies or freelancers you use, updates your content calendar, manages your marketing budget and spend allocation, prepares reports for ownership, identifies new opportunities and threats in your market, ensures brand consistency across all touchpoints, troubleshoots underperforming campaigns, and plans upcoming launches or promotions. They attend your team meetings, join vendor calls, and serve as the single point of accountability for all marketing results. Everything an in-house marketing director does — condensed into the hours your business actually needs.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many hours per month will my fractional marketing manager work?",
    a: "Hours depend on your tier. The Operator tier includes approximately 20 hours per month — enough for weekly strategy sessions, campaign oversight, and monthly reporting. The Strategist tier includes approximately 30 hours per month — adding vendor management, content planning, and bi-weekly team coordination. The Marketing Director tier includes 40 or more hours per month — full marketing department leadership with daily availability. Most service businesses in the $1M to $5M revenue range find that 20 to 30 hours per month is the right amount. We can always scale up or down based on seasonal needs or campaign launches.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a fractional marketing manager manage my existing agencies?",
    a: "Absolutely — this is one of the primary functions. Many service businesses hire an SEO agency, a PPC agency, a social media manager, and a designer, but have no one coordinating them. The result is duplicated effort, conflicting messaging, wasted budget, and no unified strategy. Your fractional marketing manager becomes the single point of oversight for all vendors. They set KPIs for each agency, review deliverables, hold agencies accountable, ensure messaging consistency, and reallocate budget based on what is actually working. Most clients save 20% to 30% on their total marketing spend within 90 days just from better vendor coordination.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you also execute marketing campaigns or just manage them?",
    a: "Both. As an agency that offers fractional marketing management, we have the unique advantage of being able to both lead strategy and execute it. If you need SEO, we handle it in-house. If you need web development, we build on Next.js. If you need content, our team writes it. If you need CRM setup, we deploy Full Loop CRM. For channels outside our core expertise, we manage your existing vendors or bring in trusted partners from our network. The result is a single accountable leader who can both direct the orchestra and play the instruments when needed.",
  },
  {
    q: "What industries do you serve as a fractional marketing manager?",
    a: "We specialize in local service businesses across the NYC metro area — the same industries we serve for SEO, web development, and digital marketing. This includes plumbers, electricians, HVAC companies, general contractors, lawyers, dentists, therapists, cleaning services, salons, landscapers, and over 150 additional service categories. We understand the unique marketing challenges service businesses face: seasonality, local competition, review management, lead attribution, and the need to generate phone calls — not just website traffic. Our strategies are built specifically for businesses that serve customers in defined geographic areas.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly can a fractional marketing manager start producing results?",
    a: "You will see organizational improvements within the first 30 days — clearer strategy, better vendor coordination, consolidated reporting, and identified waste in your current spend. Measurable performance improvements typically appear within 60 to 90 days as optimized campaigns take effect. By month 4 to 6, most clients see a 25% to 40% improvement in marketing ROI from the combination of strategic realignment, budget optimization, and better execution. The fastest wins usually come from fixing what is broken — we consistently find that new clients are wasting 20% to 40% of their marketing budget on underperforming channels, duplicated tools, or misaligned agency work.",
  },
  {
    q: "What marketing tools and platforms do you work with?",
    a: "We work with the entire modern marketing stack. For analytics: Google Analytics 4, Google Search Console, Google Tag Manager, and custom dashboards. For SEO: Ahrefs, Screaming Frog, Semrush, and proprietary tools. For paid ads: Google Ads, Meta Ads Manager, and Microsoft Advertising. For CRM: Full Loop CRM — our own full-cycle CRM built for service businesses — plus HubSpot, Salesforce, and GoHighLevel if you are already on one. For email: Resend, Mailchimp, or Klaviyo. For communication: Telnyx for SMS and voice. For development: Next.js, Vercel, Supabase. We are technology-agnostic but opinionated — we will tell you which tools are worth paying for and which ones are wasting your money.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you measure and report on marketing performance?",
    a: "Every client receives a comprehensive monthly marketing report covering all active channels — organic search rankings and traffic, paid ad performance and ROAS, social media engagement and conversions, email open and click rates, lead volume by source, cost per lead by channel, and overall marketing ROI. We track phone calls, form submissions, and booked appointments attributed to specific campaigns and keywords. Reports include a recorded video walkthrough explaining what the numbers mean, what we did this month, and what we are doing next. No vanity metrics. No fluff. Just the data that tells you whether your marketing investment is working.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the minimum commitment for fractional marketing management?",
    a: "We recommend a minimum 6-month engagement to see meaningful results. Marketing strategy takes time to implement and optimize — anyone who promises overnight transformation is not being honest. That said, we do not lock you into long-term contracts. After the initial 6-month period, you can continue month-to-month, scale up, scale down, or pause. Most clients stay with us for 12 to 24 months because the ROI is clear and compounding. We earn your business every month — not through contract terms, but through results.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you help build a marketing team as we grow?",
    a: "Yes. One of the natural evolution paths of fractional marketing management is helping you build and hire your internal marketing team when the business is ready. We help you define roles, write job descriptions, interview candidates, onboard new hires, and create the processes and playbooks they will follow. Many of our clients start with a fractional marketing manager, grow their revenue 30% to 50%, and then bring on a junior marketing coordinator or content specialist to handle day-to-day execution while we continue providing strategic oversight. We are not threatened by this — it means we did our job.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens during the onboarding process?",
    a: "Onboarding takes 2 to 3 weeks and is thorough. We start with a deep-dive discovery session covering your business goals, revenue targets, current marketing channels, past performance, competitive landscape, and customer journey. We then audit everything — your website, SEO, paid ads, social media, email marketing, CRM, vendor contracts, and marketing spend. We interview key team members and review your sales process. The output is a comprehensive marketing audit document and a 90-day strategic plan with specific priorities, KPIs, and action items. From there, we hit the ground running with clear direction and measurable milestones.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you work on-site or remotely?",
    a: "Primarily remote, with regular in-person meetings for NYC-area clients. Most of our collaboration happens through scheduled video calls, Slack or Teams, shared project management tools, and monthly in-person strategy sessions at our Midtown Manhattan office near Times Square. For major campaign launches, annual planning, or team workshops, we come to your office. The hybrid model gives you the flexibility of remote work with the personal connection of face-to-face meetings. Our address is 150 W 47th St, New York, NY 10036 — right in the heart of Midtown.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why should I hire The NYC SEO as my fractional marketing manager instead of an independent consultant?",
    a: "An independent consultant gives you one person with one perspective. When you hire us, you get a marketing leader backed by a full agency — SEO specialists, web developers, content writers, designers, CRM engineers, and AI specialists. If your fractional marketing manager identifies that you need a new website, we build it. If you need an AI chatbot for lead qualification, we develop it. If you need 500 location pages for SEO, we generate them programmatically. An independent consultant would need to outsource all of that — adding cost, complexity, and communication overhead. With us, strategy and execution live under the same roof.",

              social media freelancer, Google Ads — but no one is driving the bus. No one is looking at the full picture, connecting the dots between channels, holding vendors accountable, or tying marketing spend back to actual revenue. You need a marketing leader. But a full-time marketing director in New York City costs $150,000 to $200,000 per year in salary alone, before benefits, payroll taxes, equipment, and management overhead. For a service business doing $1M to $5M in revenue, that is a brutal line item.
            </p>

              A fractional marketing manager solves this problem. You get an experienced, senior-level marketing leader who works with your business 20 to 40 hours per month on a retainer basis. They set the strategy, build the roadmap, manage your agencies and freelancers, allocate your budget, track performance, and report directly to ownership. They are your marketing department head — they just are not on your payroll full-time. The fractional model works because most service businesses do not need 40 hours per week of marketing leadership. They need 20 to 30 hours of the right leadership — someone who has managed millions in ad spend, launched hundreds of campaigns, and knows exactly which levers to pull for{" "}

              The difference between a business with marketing leadership and one without is the difference between a coordinated growth machine and a collection of disconnected tactics that hemorrhage money. When you have a fractional marketing manager, every campaign serves the strategy. Every vendor is held to KPIs. Every dollar is tracked. When you do not, you get agencies that operate in silos, content that does not support your SEO, ads that send traffic to pages that do not convert, and a total marketing spend that nobody can justify with real numbers.

We map your entire business — revenue goals, customer acquisition costs, lifetime customer value, current marketing channels, historical performance, competitive landscape, and team structure. We interview key stakeholders, review your sales process from first touch to closed deal, and identify every gap in your current marketing operation. This is not a 30-minute intake call.

Your paid advertising gets a spend-efficiency analysis — cost per lead, cost per acquisition, and ROAS by campaign. Your SEO gets a rankings and visibility assessment. Your social media, email marketing, CRM utilization, and offline channels all get evaluated. We also audit your vendor relationships — what you are paying each agency or freelancer, what they are delivering, and whether the ROI justifies the spend.

          <p className="mt-4 text-zinc-400">
            There are several ways to handle marketing leadership. Here is how a fractional marketing manager compares to the alternatives service businesses typically consider.
          </p>
          <div className="mt-10 space-y-8">
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#EFF70A]">Fractional Marketing Manager vs. Full-Time CMO</h3>
              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                A full-time Chief Marketing Officer in NYC commands a salary of $180,000 to $300,000 per year — plus benefits, equity, bonuses, and management overhead. Total cost: $250,000 to $400,000 annually. For a service business doing $2M to $10M in revenue, that is 5% to 20% of your top line just for one person. A fractional marketing manager delivers the same strategic leadership, vendor oversight, and accountability for $60,000 to $120,000 per year. You get 80% of the value at 30% of the cost. The math makes sense until your business grows large enough to justify — and fully utilize — a full-time executive. For most service businesses, that inflection point is $10M to $15M in annual revenue.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#EFF70A]">Fractional Marketing Manager vs. DIY Marketing</h3>
              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                Many service business owners try to manage marketing themselves. The problem is clear: you are an expert at your trade, not at marketing. DIY marketing leads to random acts of marketing — a Facebook post here, a Google Ad there, a website that has not been updated in two years. There is no strategy, no measurement, and no accountability. The owner spends 10 to 15 hours per week on marketing tasks they are not qualified to do, which means 10 to 15 hours per week not spent on operations, sales, or client delivery. A fractional marketing manager frees the owner to focus on what they do best while ensuring marketing is handled by someone who has done it hundreds of times before. The ROI is not just financial — it is the owner&apos;s time and sanity.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#EFF70A]">Fractional Marketing Manager vs. Marketing Agency Only</h3>
              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                Hiring a marketing agency without marketing leadership is like hiring a construction crew without a general contractor. The agency will execute their specific scope — run your{" "}
                <Link href="/services/seo" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">SEO</Link>, manage your ads, write your content — but they will not coordinate with your other vendors, manage your overall budget, align messaging across channels, or hold themselves accountable to business outcomes instead of activity metrics. A fractional marketing manager sits above the agencies, ensuring every vendor is pulling in the same direction. They catch duplicated effort, identify conflicting strategies, reallocate budget from underperforming channels, and create a unified marketing operation instead of a collection of disconnected services. The agencies are the specialists. The fractional marketing manager is the general.

              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                Some businesses try to solve the leadership gap by hiring a junior marketing coordinator or social media manager for $50,000 to $70,000 per year. The problem is that a junior hire needs direction — they need someone to tell them what to do, review their work, and set the strategy. Without senior oversight, they default to tactical busywork that looks like marketing but does not move the needle. A fractional marketing manager costs slightly more per month but brings 15 to 20 years of experience, strategic thinking, and the ability to manage agencies, coordinate teams, and make high-stakes budget decisions. The junior hire should come later — after the fractional marketing manager has built the strategy, systems, and playbooks they will follow.

Without a marketing leader, each vendor optimizes for their own metrics with no connection to your business goals.

Without a documented strategy and 90-day roadmap, marketing becomes a collection of disconnected activities that feel productive but produce nothing. We build the strategy first, then execute systematically against it.",

A fractional marketing manager takes the marketing burden off your plate completely, so you can focus on what generates revenue.",

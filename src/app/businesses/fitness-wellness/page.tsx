    {
      q: "How much does SEO cost for a fitness or gym business in NYC?",
      a: "SEO retainers for fitness and wellness businesses start at $3,500/month, covering local SEO, Google Business Profile optimization, content marketing, on-page SEO, and AI search optimization. Project-based work like website builds or GBP optimization starts at $2,500. The investment depends on how many locations you operate and how many neighborhoods you want to dominate. A single-location yoga studio needs less than a multi-location gym chain.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long until my gym or studio ranks on Google in NYC?",
      a: "Most fitness businesses see measurable ranking improvements in 60-90 days, with significant gains in 4-6 months. Google Business Profile optimizations can impact your Maps ranking within weeks. Competitive neighborhoods like the Upper East Side, Williamsburg, and Park Slope take longer because more studios are fighting for the same spots. We provide monthly progress reports from day one.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you work with personal trainers or just gyms?",
      a: "We work with every type of fitness and wellness business: personal trainers, yoga studios, Pilates studios, gyms, martial arts schools, boxing gyms, CrossFit boxes, dance studios, and wellness centers. Each business type gets a tailored keyword strategy because someone searching for a personal trainer has different intent than someone searching for a gym membership.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can you help my fitness business show up on ChatGPT and Perplexity?",
      a: "Yes. AI search optimization is one of our core services. When someone asks ChatGPT 'best yoga studio in Williamsburg' or 'find a personal trainer near me in Midtown,' we make sure your business is what gets recommended. We structure your content with entity relationships, authority signals, and citation patterns that AI platforms use to formulate answers.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do you handle SEO for fitness businesses with multiple locations?",
      a: "Each location gets its own Google Business Profile, dedicated landing pages for surrounding neighborhoods, and location-specific content. We build a separate local SEO strategy for each location while maintaining brand consistency across all of them. Multi-location gyms benefit from programmatic page generation that scales content across every service area.",
    },
    {
      q: "What makes your agency different for fitness SEO?",
      a: "Three things separate us. First, we build on Next.js, not WordPress, so your site scores 95+ on Core Web Vitals and loads faster than your competitors. Second, we use programmatic SEO to generate hundreds of neighborhood-specific pages at scale. Third, we optimize for AI search platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity, which 95% of agencies still ignore. We also provide Full Loop CRM to convert traffic into booked sessions.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you build location pages for fitness businesses?",
      a: `Yes. We generate optimized landing pages for every neighborhood you serve. A gym targeting the full NYC metro area gets ${totalNeighborhoods}+ unique pages, each targeting searches like "gym in Astoria" or "personal trainer Park Slope" with original content, schema markup, and internal linking.`,
    },
    {
      q: "How do you handle Google Business Profile for gyms and studios?",
      a: "We optimize every element: primary and secondary categories, business description, service areas covering every neighborhood you serve, class listings, weekly Google Posts featuring promotions and class schedules, Q&A seeding with common fitness questions, photo optimization, review generation strategy, and review response management. For multi-location businesses, we manage separate profiles for each gym or studio.",

The fitness industry in NYC is uniquely competitive because proximity drives membership decisions. A potential member will almost always choose a studio within walking distance over one across town. That means you need to rank in your specific neighborhood, not just &ldquo;NYC&rdquo; broadly.

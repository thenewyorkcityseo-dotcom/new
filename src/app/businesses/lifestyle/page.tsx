const faqs = [
  {
    q: "How does SEO help a dry cleaning business get more customers?",
    a: "Dry cleaning is a hyper-local search — people want the closest option to their apartment or commute. Local SEO puts your business in the Google Maps 3-pack for searches like 'dry cleaner near me' and 'same day dry cleaning [neighborhood].' We also optimize your Google Business Profile, build local citations, and create content that targets the specific neighborhoods you serve.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is SEO worth it for a laundromat?",
    a: "Yes. Millions of NYC residents without in-unit laundry search for laundromats online. 'Laundromat near me' and 'wash and fold [neighborhood]' are high-intent queries that drive foot traffic directly. SEO ensures your laundromat appears in Maps, organic results, and increasingly in AI search tools like ChatGPT when residents ask for recommendations.",
  },
  {
    q: "What keywords should a tailor target for SEO?",
    a: "High-value tailor keywords include 'tailor near me,' 'suit alterations [neighborhood],' 'custom tailor NYC,' and 'wedding dress alterations [borough].' We also target long-tail queries like 'affordable suit tailoring Midtown' and 'same day hem repair NYC' that capture customers with immediate needs and high purchase intent.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long before a lifestyle business sees SEO results?",
    a: "Most lifestyle businesses see ranking improvements within 3-5 months for neighborhood-level keywords. Broader terms like 'best dry cleaner NYC' take 6-12 months depending on competition. The advantage of lifestyle SEO is that local intent keywords often have less competition than other industries, so results can come faster.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you manage Google Business Profiles for lifestyle businesses?",
    a: "Yes — GBP management is included in every engagement. For lifestyle businesses, we optimize your business categories, service descriptions, photos, hours, and review response strategy. We also create Google Posts highlighting seasonal services, promotions, and new offerings to keep your profile active and visible.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can AI search optimization help my lifestyle business?",
    a: "Absolutely. When someone asks ChatGPT 'best dry cleaner in the West Village' or 'where should I get my suit altered in Brooklyn,' your business needs to be in that answer. Our AI search optimization ensures your website has the structured data, content authority, and citation profile that AI tools use to generate recommendations.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the $3,500/month retainer include for lifestyle businesses?",
    a: "The retainer covers keyword strategy, on-page and technical SEO, Google Business Profile management, content creation, local citation building, off-page SEO, review strategy, AI search optimization, and detailed monthly reporting. For lifestyle businesses we focus heavily on neighborhood targeting and 'near me' optimization.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you build websites for dry cleaners and laundromats?",
    a: "Yes. We design and develop fast, mobile-optimized websites for lifestyle businesses. Features include online scheduling, service area pages, pricing displays, pickup/delivery booking integration, and review showcases. Every site is built on a modern framework optimized for search performance and conversion.",

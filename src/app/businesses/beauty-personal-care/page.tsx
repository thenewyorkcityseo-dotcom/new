const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Why is SEO important for hair salons and beauty businesses?",
    a: "Beauty is one of the most locally searched industries on Google. 'Hair salon near me,' 'nail salon [neighborhood],' and 'best barber in Brooklyn' are searched tens of thousands of times monthly in NYC alone. Instagram drives brand awareness, but Google drives booked appointments. Clients who search Google are ready to book — they're not browsing for inspiration. SEO puts your salon in front of those high-intent clients at the exact moment they're looking for a new stylist, nail tech, or aesthetician.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take for a salon to rank on Google?",
    a: "Most beauty businesses start seeing local pack (Google Maps) improvements within 6-10 weeks. Organic rankings for competitive terms like 'hair salon Williamsburg' or 'med spa Midtown' typically take 3-5 months to reach page one. New salons with no existing web presence take longer, but the local nature of beauty searches means you don't need to outrank national brands — you just need to outrank the shops on your block.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you help a med spa rank for treatment-specific keywords?",
    a: "Absolutely. Med spas have a unique SEO opportunity because clients search for specific treatments: 'Botox NYC,' 'laser hair removal Brooklyn,' 'chemical peel Upper East Side.' We build dedicated pages for every treatment you offer, optimized with medical schema markup, before-and-after content strategies, and the E-E-A-T signals Google requires for medical-adjacent content. Treatment pages often convert at 3-5x the rate of generic spa pages.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do Google reviews impact a beauty business's rankings?",
    a: "Google reviews are one of the strongest ranking signals for local search. Salons and spas with 100+ reviews and a 4.5+ rating consistently outrank competitors in the map pack. Beyond rankings, reviews directly impact booking decisions — 88% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. We implement review acquisition systems that consistently grow your review count while maintaining authenticity.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the ROI of SEO for a beauty business?",
    a: "A single new regular client is worth $2,000-$5,000+ annually (bi-weekly visits at $75-$200 per visit). Our monthly retainer is $3,500. If SEO brings in just 2-3 new regular clients per month, the return exceeds 10x the investment within the first year. For med spas, where individual treatment packages can exceed $1,000-$5,000, a single new client can cover months of SEO investment.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you handle Instagram and social media for salons too?",
    a: "Our focus is search — Google, AI platforms, and local directories. That said, our content marketing and branding services complement your social media presence. We ensure your website and Google Business Profile showcase the same quality portfolio work you post on Instagram, and we structure your content so that blog posts and service pages can be repurposed as social content. For dedicated social media management, we can recommend partners.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does AI search affect beauty businesses?",
    a: "More consumers are asking AI assistants 'best hair salon for balayage in NYC' or 'affordable nail salon in SoHo.' AI models like ChatGPT and Perplexity pull from authoritative web content to generate recommendations. If your salon has a well-structured site with strong reviews, detailed service pages, and quality backlinks, you're far more likely to be recommended. We specifically optimize for this emerging channel.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's included in your beauty business SEO package?",
    a: "Our monthly retainer ($3,500/mo) includes: full technical SEO audit and fixes, Google Business Profile optimization and management, content creation (service pages, location pages, blog posts), local citation building, review management strategy, AI search optimization, link building, and monthly performance reporting with strategy calls. Everything is tailored to beauty and personal care — we understand your industry's unique search patterns.",

  {
    q: "How does SEO help an auto mechanic shop get more customers?",
    a: "When someone's car breaks down or they need routine maintenance, they search 'auto mechanic near me' or 'car repair [neighborhood].' SEO puts your shop at the top of those results. We optimize your Google Business Profile so you appear in the local map pack, build location-specific pages targeting every neighborhood you serve, and create content around common repair questions that drives organic traffic. The result: more phone calls, more walk-ins, and higher-value repair jobs.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long before our auto shop starts ranking on Google?",
    a: "Most automotive businesses see meaningful ranking improvements within 2-4 months. Local pack rankings (Google Maps) often move faster because automotive searches are heavily local. Competitive terms like 'auto body shop Brooklyn' or 'car detailing Manhattan' may take 4-6 months to crack the top positions. Emergency searches like 'towing near me' can rank quickly because Google heavily favors proximity and relevance for urgent queries.",
  },
  {
    q: "What keywords should automotive businesses target?",
    a: "We target three categories: emergency keywords ('towing near me,' 'flat tire help'), service keywords ('brake repair NYC,' 'oil change Brooklyn,' 'ceramic coating Queens'), and research keywords ('how much does a transmission repair cost in NYC'). Each keyword type maps to a different page type and conversion path. Emergency keywords need your phone number front and center. Service keywords need detailed pages. Research keywords need helpful content that builds trust.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you manage Google reviews for auto shops?",
    a: "Review management is a core part of our local SEO service. We implement review acquisition systems that encourage satisfied customers to leave Google reviews, provide response templates for positive and negative reviews, and monitor your review profile for reputation threats. For auto shops, reviews are especially critical because trust is everything when someone is handing over their car and their credit card.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does SEO cost for an automotive business?",
    a: "Our monthly retainer starts at $3,500/month for full-service SEO including strategy, content, technical optimization, GBP management, and reporting. Project-based work starts at $2,500, and hourly consulting is $150/hour. For automotive businesses, the ROI is strong: a single engine repair job can be worth $2,000-$5,000, meaning one new customer per month more than covers the investment.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can SEO help a towing company get emergency calls?",
    a: "Absolutely. Towing searches are almost entirely 'near me' and emergency-driven, which means Google Maps and local SEO dominate. We optimize your Google Business Profile for 24/7 availability, build pages targeting every neighborhood and highway corridor you serve, ensure your phone number is click-to-call on mobile, and get your site loading fast enough that someone stranded on the BQE doesn't bounce to a competitor.",
  },
  {
    q: "What about AI search — does it matter for auto shops?",
    a: "It's becoming increasingly important. When someone asks ChatGPT or Perplexity 'best auto mechanic in Astoria' or 'where to get a car detailed in NYC,' AI models pull from web content to generate recommendations. Our AI search optimization ensures your business is structured, cited, and authoritative enough to be included in those AI-generated responses. This is a competitive advantage most auto shops haven't even considered yet.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you build websites for auto shops or just do SEO?",
    a: "We do both. Many auto shops have outdated websites that can't rank regardless of how much SEO work is done. Our web design and development service builds fast, mobile-first sites specifically designed for automotive businesses — prominent phone numbers, service menus, online scheduling, and photo galleries that showcase your work. A great site is the foundation that SEO builds on.",

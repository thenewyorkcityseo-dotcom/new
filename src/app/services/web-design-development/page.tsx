const faqs = [
  {
    q: "How much does a custom website cost in NYC?",
    a: "Our custom Next.js website projects start at $10,000 for a streamlined service business site (10-20 pages) and scale to $50,000+ for full-scale SEO platforms with programmatic page generation, custom CRM integration, and AI agent functionality. WordPress migration projects start at $7,500 and range up to $35,000 depending on site size and complexity. Every project is scoped individually based on your business needs, the number of pages required, integration complexity, and whether you need programmatic SEO at scale. We provide a detailed, line-item proposal before any work begins — no surprise costs, no hidden fees.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do you build on Next.js instead of WordPress?",
    a: "WordPress powers roughly 43% of the internet, but that does not make it the best choice for businesses that depend on search rankings. WordPress sites average 3-5 second load times, suffer from plugin bloat and security vulnerabilities, struggle with Core Web Vitals, and cannot efficiently generate thousands of programmatic SEO pages. Next.js delivers sub-1-second page loads through static generation, scores 95-100 on PageSpeed Insights, has zero plugin dependencies, and scales to 54,000+ pages without performance degradation. For businesses where organic search is the primary growth channel, the framework you build on is a direct competitive advantage. We chose Next.js because it eliminates the technical SEO problems that WordPress creates.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to build a custom website?",
    a: "A standard service business website (15-30 pages) takes 4 to 6 weeks from kickoff to launch. Larger projects with programmatic page generation, CRM integration, and custom functionality take 8 to 12 weeks. WordPress migration projects take 3 to 6 weeks depending on site complexity and content volume. We work in two-week sprints with regular check-ins so you see progress throughout the build, not just at the end. Rush timelines are available for an additional fee.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is static site generation and why does it matter for SEO?",
    a: "Static site generation (SSG) pre-renders every page of your website as pure HTML at build time. When a user visits your site, the server delivers a pre-built HTML file instantly — no database queries, no server-side processing, no waiting. This is why our sites load in under 1 second. Google has confirmed that page speed is a direct ranking factor, and Core Web Vitals — which heavily reward fast-loading pages — directly influence where your site appears in search results. WordPress generates pages dynamically on every request, which is inherently slower. Next.js gives us the option to statically generate pages, server-side render them, or use incremental static regeneration — we choose the right approach for each page based on how frequently the content changes.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are Core Web Vitals and why do they matter?",
    a: "Core Web Vitals are three specific metrics Google uses to evaluate user experience: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures loading performance, First Input Delay / Interaction to Next Paint (INP) measures interactivity, and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) measures visual stability. Since 2021, these metrics directly influence Google rankings. Sites that pass Core Web Vitals get a ranking boost; sites that fail get penalized. Every website we build is engineered to pass all three metrics with room to spare. Our average LCP is under 1.2 seconds, our INP is under 100ms, and our CLS is near zero. Most WordPress sites fail at least one Core Web Vital out of the box.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you migrate my WordPress site to Next.js?",
    a: "Yes. WordPress migration is one of our most requested services. We handle the entire process — content migration, URL mapping and 301 redirects, design recreation or redesign, structured data implementation, and post-launch monitoring to ensure zero ranking loss. Migration projects start at $7,500 for smaller sites and range up to $35,000 for large, complex WordPress installations with custom post types, WooCommerce, or extensive plugin dependencies. Most clients see measurable performance improvements within 30 days of migration — faster load times, better Core Web Vitals, and improved crawl efficiency.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is programmatic SEO and how does it work with web design?",
    a: "Programmatic SEO uses data and code to generate hundreds or thousands of unique, optimized pages at scale. For a plumber serving 50 neighborhoods and offering 8 services, that is 400 unique landing pages — each targeting a real search query like 'emergency plumber Park Slope' or 'water heater installation Astoria.' Building those pages manually would take months. Our Next.js platform generates them programmatically using structured data, dynamic templates, and location-specific content. Each page is unique, each page is optimized, and each page targets a real keyword with real search volume. This is how we build 54,000+ page platforms that a traditional agency could not produce in a decade.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer website maintenance and hosting?",
    a: "Yes. Every site we build is deployed on Vercel, which provides global edge hosting, automatic SSL certificates, instant rollbacks, and 99.99% uptime. Monthly maintenance plans include security monitoring, performance optimization, content updates, dependency updates, uptime monitoring, and priority support. Maintenance plans start at $500 per month for standard sites and scale based on site complexity and update frequency. Hosting is included in all maintenance plans.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is server-side rendering and when do you use it?",
    a: "Server-side rendering (SSR) generates a page on the server at the moment a user requests it. Unlike static generation — which pre-builds pages at deploy time — SSR produces a fresh page for every request. We use SSR for pages that need real-time data: search results, personalized content, dynamic pricing, or pages that change frequently. The key advantage over WordPress is that Next.js SSR pages still load significantly faster because Next.js renders the initial HTML on the server and then hydrates it with React on the client. WordPress does server-side rendering too, but it does it through a PHP/MySQL stack that is inherently slower and less efficient.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is Vercel and why do you deploy there?",
    a: "Vercel is the platform built by the creators of Next.js. It deploys your website to a global edge network — meaning your site is served from the data center closest to each visitor, reducing latency to near zero. Vercel provides instant deployments, automatic preview URLs for every code change, built-in analytics, serverless functions, and enterprise-grade infrastructure. For NYC businesses, Vercel serves your site from edge nodes in the northeast United States, delivering sub-100ms time-to-first-byte for local visitors. We deploy exclusively on Vercel because it is the fastest, most reliable hosting platform for Next.js applications.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you build e-commerce websites?",
    a: "Our primary focus is service business websites engineered for SEO and lead generation. We do not build Shopify or WooCommerce stores. If your business needs a transactional component — appointment booking, quote request forms, payment processing — we build those features as custom integrations within your Next.js site using Supabase for the backend and Stripe for payments. For full e-commerce operations, we recommend working with an agency that specializes in that vertical.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is Supabase and why do you use it?",
    a: "Supabase is an open-source backend platform that provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, file storage, and serverless edge functions. We use Supabase instead of traditional backend solutions because it integrates seamlessly with Next.js, scales automatically, and gives us complete control over the data layer without the overhead of managing servers. For our clients, Supabase powers contact forms, CRM functionality through Full Loop CRM, lead tracking, analytics dashboards, and any custom business logic your site needs. It is the same technology stack that powers our own platform at thenycseo.com.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is Tailwind CSS and why does it matter?",
    a: "Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that lets us build custom designs without writing bloated stylesheets. Unlike WordPress themes that load 200-500KB of unused CSS, Tailwind only ships the styles your site actually uses — typically 10-30KB after compression. Less CSS means faster page loads, which means better Core Web Vitals, which means higher Google rankings. Tailwind also ensures design consistency across every page and makes it easy to build fully responsive layouts that look perfect on every screen size from mobile to desktop.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you build a custom CRM into my website?",
    a: "Yes. Full Loop CRM is our custom CRM platform built on the same Next.js, Supabase, and Vercel stack we use for client websites. It handles lead capture, pipeline management, automated follow-ups via Resend (email) and Telnyx (SMS), appointment scheduling, review request automation, and detailed analytics. Full Loop CRM can be integrated directly into your website or deployed as a standalone application. It is fully customizable for any business type and does not charge per-seat fees like Salesforce or HubSpot.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do your websites handle structured data and schema markup?",
    a: "Every website we build includes comprehensive JSON-LD structured data — typically 6 to 10 schema types per page. This includes Organization, LocalBusiness, ProfessionalService, Service with OfferCatalog, FAQPage, HowTo, Review, AggregateRating, BreadcrumbList, and WebSite schemas. We implement this at the code level in Next.js, which means structured data is embedded directly in the page HTML — not injected by a plugin that can break or conflict with other plugins. This structured data is what Google uses for rich results and what AI search platforms use to understand and recommend your business.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens to my SEO rankings when I redesign my website?",
    a: "This is the question that keeps business owners up at night — and it is the reason most agencies do more harm than good during a redesign. When we rebuild a website, we map every existing URL to its new equivalent, implement 301 redirects for any URL changes, preserve all existing structured data and schema markup, maintain internal linking architecture, and monitor Google Search Console daily for 90 days after launch. Our goal is zero ranking disruption. In practice, most of our redesign clients see rankings improve within 30 to 60 days because the new Next.js site loads faster, has cleaner code, and passes Core Web Vitals — all direct ranking factors.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you design logos and brand identity?",
    a: "Yes. Our parent company, Consortium NYC, has provided branding services for over 20 years. We offer logo design, brand identity systems, color palettes, typography selection, and brand guidelines as standalone services or as part of a website project. Visit our branding services page for more details.",

              Google Ads, social media — drives traffic to one place: your website. If that website loads slowly, looks broken on mobile, lacks structured data, and cannot scale beyond 50 pages without collapsing under its own weight, every marketing dollar you spend is partially wasted. Your website is not a cost center. It is the single most important revenue-generating asset your business owns.

            <p>
              Most NYC service businesses are running websites built on WordPress themes from 2018. They load in 3 to 5 seconds. They fail Core Web Vitals. They have 15 plugins fighting with each other. They have no structured data, no internal linking strategy, and no ability to generate the hundreds of location-specific pages needed to compete in a market as dense and competitive as New York City. These businesses are leaving tens of thousands of dollars per month on the table — and they do not even know it.
            </p>
            <p>
              We build websites differently. Every site we create is a custom{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">Next.js</strong> application — hand-coded in React, styled with Tailwind CSS, deployed on Vercel&apos;s global edge network, and backed by Supabase for any data or CRM needs. These are not WordPress sites with a fresh coat of paint. These are purpose-built{" "}

              engineered to load in under one second, pass every Core Web Vital, scale to tens of thousands of pages, and feed structured data to both traditional search engines and AI models. When we say your website is built to rank, we mean it at the code level — not the theme level.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is what separates us from every other web design agency in New York. We do not build pretty websites that happen to have SEO bolted on afterward. We build SEO-first platforms that also happen to look incredible. The architecture, the URL structure, the internal linking, the schema markup, the page speed, the rendering strategy — every technical decision is made with search performance as the primary constraint. Design serves the user experience. Engineering serves the search engine. Both serve your bottom line.

This phase typically takes 1 to 2 weeks and produces a detailed project specification that becomes the blueprint for everything that follows.

            Programmatic SEO at Scale: 54,000+ Pages and Counting
          </h2>
          <div className="mt-8 space-y-6 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Here is the math that most web design agencies never do. A plumber in NYC offers 8 services — drain cleaning, pipe repair, water heater installation, sewer line repair, faucet repair, toilet installation, gas line repair, and emergency plumbing. That plumber serves 50 neighborhoods across Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan. That is 400 unique keyword combinations — each representing a real search query with real search volume. &ldquo;Drain cleaning Park Slope.&rdquo; &ldquo;Water heater installation Astoria.&rdquo; &ldquo;Emergency plumber Upper West Side.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p>
              Building 400 unique, optimized landing pages manually would take a traditional agency months — and cost tens of thousands of dollars in content creation alone. With our Next.js platform, we build a template once, connect it to a data source, and generate all 400 pages programmatically. Each page has unique content, proper heading structure, location-specific details, relevant{" "}
              <Link href="/services/on-page-seo" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">on-page SEO</Link>{" "}
              elements, JSON-LD structured data, internal links to related pages, and a clear call-to-action. Every page is pre-rendered as static HTML at build time, served from Vercel&apos;s edge network, and loads in under one second.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is how we built <Link href="/" className="text-[#5CB8FF] hover:text-[#8DD0FF]">thenycseo.com</Link> itself — 170+ service categories across 318 neighborhoods generating over 54,000 unique pages. Every page is indexed. Every page targets a real keyword. Every page loads in under a second. WordPress cannot do this. Wix cannot do this. Squarespace cannot do this. This is what a purpose-built Next.js SEO platform makes possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              For our clients, programmatic SEO means dominating the long-tail keywords that drive the highest-converting traffic. When someone searches &ldquo;emergency plumber Park Slope at 2am,&rdquo; they are not browsing — they have a flooded apartment and they need help now. Having a dedicated, optimized page for that exact query means you show up first, and you get the call. Multiply that across every service, every neighborhood, and every variation of how customers search — and you have a lead generation engine that no amount of Google Ads can match.

            Core Web Vitals: Why Page Speed Is a Ranking Factor
          </h2>
          <div className="mt-8 space-y-6 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              In 2021, Google made Core Web Vitals a direct ranking signal. That means the speed, interactivity, and visual stability of your website directly influence where you appear in search results. This is not a suggestion from Google — it is a measurable part of their algorithm. Faster sites rank higher. Slower sites get pushed down. The data is unambiguous.
            </p>
            <p>
              Core Web Vitals consist of three metrics. <strong className="text-white">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</strong> measures how quickly the main content of your page loads — Google wants this under 2.5 seconds, we target under 1.2 seconds. <strong className="text-white">Interaction to Next Paint (INP)</strong> measures how quickly your site responds to user interactions — Google wants this under 200ms, we target under 100ms. <strong className="text-white">Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</strong> measures visual stability — whether elements on the page jump around as it loads. Google wants this under 0.1, we target near zero.
            </p>
            <p>
              The average WordPress site fails at least one Core Web Vital. The average site we build passes all three with room to spare. This is not because we are better designers — it is because Next.js and our tech stack are fundamentally faster than WordPress. Static HTML served from Vercel&apos;s edge network will always be faster than dynamically generated PHP pages served from a shared hosting account. Tailwind CSS (10-30KB) will always be lighter than a WordPress theme (200-500KB). React server components will always be more efficient than jQuery plugins fighting over the DOM.
            </p>
            <p>
              For our clients, this performance advantage translates directly into higher rankings, better click-through rates, and more leads. A one-second improvement in page speed can increase conversions by 7%. When your competitors are loading in 4 seconds and you are loading in 0.8 seconds, that performance gap compounds into a significant competitive advantage — not just in rankings, but in the user experience that turns visitors into customers.

                We do not build on WordPress. We do not build on Wix. We do not build on Squarespace, Webflow, or any other template-based platform.

Template platforms impose technical constraints that limit your SEO ceiling. Custom code removes those constraints entirely. When your competitors are fighting with WordPress plugin conflicts, your Next.js site is loading in under one second and ranking on page one.

You have to build the architecture around SEO.

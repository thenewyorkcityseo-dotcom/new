const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Does SEO work for B2B service companies, not just B2C?",
    a: "Absolutely. B2B buyers search Google the same way consumers do -- they type 'IT support company NYC' or 'marketing agency for law firms.' The difference is longer sales cycles and higher contract values. SEO positions your firm as the answer to those searches, feeding your pipeline with qualified prospects who are actively looking for what you sell.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long before we see ROI from SEO as a B2B company?",
    a: "B2B SEO typically shows meaningful pipeline impact within 4-6 months. Because B2B contract values are higher ($5K-$50K+ annually), even a few new clients from organic search can deliver significant ROI. We track leads-to-close attribution so you see exactly which keywords and pages drive revenue, not just traffic.",
  },
  {
    q: "What makes SEO different for business service companies vs. consumer businesses?",
    a: "B2B search intent is different. Buyers are comparing vendors, reading case studies, and evaluating expertise before making contact. We build content strategies around the entire B2B buying journey -- awareness content, comparison pages, case studies, and service-specific landing pages that convert decision-makers, not tire-kickers.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does SEO cost for a B2B service company?",
    a: "Our monthly retainer starts at $3,500/month, covering strategy, content marketing, local SEO, and AI search optimization. One-time projects like website redesigns start at $2,500. Strategy consulting is available at $150/hour for firms with internal teams that need expert guidance on SEO direction.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you help us rank for industry-specific terms alongside location terms?",
    a: "That is exactly what we do. We build keyword maps that combine industry verticals with geographic targeting -- 'healthcare IT company Manhattan,' 'law firm marketing agency NYC,' or 'commercial cleaning service Midtown.' Each combination gets its own optimized page, maximizing the number of qualified searches you appear in.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does AI search optimization help B2B companies?",
    a: "Business buyers increasingly use ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews to research vendors. When a procurement manager asks AI 'best IT support companies in NYC,' your firm needs to be in that answer. We optimize your content structure, authority signals, and entity presence so AI platforms cite your business in relevant queries.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should we invest in SEO if we already get referrals?",
    a: "Referrals are great but unpredictable. SEO creates a consistent, scalable pipeline that does not depend on who you know. More importantly, 70%+ of B2B buyers research a referred company online before making contact. If your website is invisible or unimpressive, you are losing referral-driven opportunities you never even knew about.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you work with agencies and firms that compete with each other?",
    a: "We limit category exclusivity within specific geographic markets. If we are working with a marketing agency targeting Manhattan, we will not take on a directly competing agency targeting the same area. This ensures our strategy and competitive intelligence work exclusively in your favor.",

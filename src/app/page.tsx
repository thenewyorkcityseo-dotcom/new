      q: "How long does local SEO take to start generating leads?",
      a: "Most of our clients see pages indexed within 2–4 weeks. Real ranking improvements and inbound leads typically start within 60–90 days. Unlike paid ads, organic rankings are an asset — once you rank, you stay there at $0 per click.",
    },
    {
      q: "How much does SEO cost for a small business in NYC?",
      a: "Our SEO plans start at $1,000/month for single-location businesses. Most clients invest $2,500/month for multi-area coverage. The average cost for a custom Next.js SEO platform is $5,000 — and it pays for itself in organic leads within months.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you do SEO on existing WordPress websites?",
      a: "No. We only do SEO on websites that we build. Our platforms are purpose-built for search performance from the ground up — not bolted onto WordPress or whatever your last agency set up. That's why they rank.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can SEO replace Google Ads for my service business?",
      a: "For most of our clients, yes. Our average client sees a 90% reduction in ad spend over 12 months once organic rankings kick in. Ads stop the second you stop paying. Organic SEO keeps generating leads month after month at $0 per click.",
    },
    {
      q: "What types of service businesses do you work with?",
      a: `Any service business that needs local customers — plumbers, electricians, lawyers, dentists, salons, contractors, movers, and more. We have ${totalServices} service types across ${totalNeighborhoods} neighborhoods in our platform.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Do you guarantee first page rankings on Google?",
      a: `Anyone who guarantees a #1 ranking is lying. What we guarantee is real, optimized, properly structured pages targeting the exact searches your customers make. This site has ${totalPages.toLocaleString()}+ pages — click around and see for yourself.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What is an EMD microsite and how does it help my business?",
      a: "An EMD (Exact Match Domain) microsite is a small, focused website built on a domain that matches what your customers search for — like 'brooklynplumber.com.' Search engines give weight to domain relevance, so these sites often rank faster than a generic business website. We build and manage them as part of our Starter and Domination plans.",
    },
    {
      q: "How is your SEO different from other agencies in New York?",
      a: "We build things. Not reports. Not slide decks. Real pages with real structured data that search engines index. Most agencies send you monthly reports for 6 months and hope you don't notice nothing changed. We build live, ranking pages you can see and click.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need SEO if I already get leads from word of mouth?",
      a: "Word of mouth is great but it doesn't scale. Every day, people in your area search for your exact service and find your competitors instead. Organic SEO captures that demand 24/7 — even while you sleep. It's the channel that grows alongside referrals, not instead of them.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you offer SEO services in New Jersey and Long Island?",
      a: `Yes. We cover the entire NYC metro area — all five boroughs, New Jersey, Long Island, and Westchester. That's ${totalNeighborhoods} neighborhoods and growing. Every area gets dedicated optimized pages for every service type.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What is programmatic SEO and how does it work?",
      a: `Programmatic SEO means building hundreds or thousands of optimized pages at scale — each targeting a specific service + location keyword. Instead of writing one blog post and hoping it ranks, we build a page for every combination like plumber in Brooklyn Heights or electrician in Jersey City. This site has ${totalPages.toLocaleString()}+ of them.`,
    },
    {
      q: "How do I know if my current SEO company is actually working?",
      a: "Ask yourself: can you see the pages they built? Can you search your service + your city and find them? If all you're getting is monthly reports with traffic charts, you're probably paying for nothing. With us, you can see every page we build — they're live and indexable right now.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you require long-term contracts for SEO services?",
      a: "No. We work month to month on SEO Platform plans. Microsites are a one-time build. If we're not delivering results, you shouldn't be paying us. Simple as that. No cancellation fees, no lock-in, no fine print.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is structured data and why does it matter for local SEO?",
      a: "Structured data (schema markup) tells search engines exactly what your business does, where you are, and what services you offer — in a language they understand. It's how you show up in rich results, local packs, and AI search answers. Every page we build includes 100% valid structured data. Most agencies skip this entirely.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can AI search engines like ChatGPT send leads to my business?",
      a: "Yes — and they already are. AI search converts at 4–5x the rate of traditional search. When someone asks ChatGPT or Perplexity for a plumber in Manhattan, the answer comes from pages with clean, parseable data. That's exactly how we build every page — optimized for both traditional search and AI platforms.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why should I optimize for Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo too?",
      a: "Most agencies completely ignore these engines — which is exactly why it's easier to rank on them. Bing powers every Windows device and Microsoft Edge. Yahoo has 700M+ monthly users with higher income demographics. DuckDuckGo is the fastest growing traditional search engine. We optimize for all of them at the same time.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the best SEO strategy for plumbers in Brooklyn?",
      a: "The best strategy is building dedicated, optimized pages for every neighborhood you serve. Not one 'plumbing services' page — but individual pages for Brooklyn Heights, Williamsburg, Park Slope, and every other neighborhood. Each with structured data, proper schema, and content that matches what people actually search.",
    },
    {
      q: "How much can I save by switching from Google Ads to organic SEO?",
      a: "Our average client reduces ad spend by 90% over 12 months. If you're spending $3,000/month on Google Ads, that's $36,000/year in clicks that stop the second you pause the campaign. With a $2,500/month SEO plan, your organic leads keep coming at $0 per click — forever.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you build websites or just do SEO optimization?",
      a: "We build the website and do the SEO — they're inseparable. Our platforms are custom Next.js builds designed from the ground up for search performance. That includes your website, your service pages, location pages, structured data, sitemaps, and everything else. It's one system that does it all.",
    },
    {
      q: "What areas in Queens do you cover for local SEO?",
      a: "We cover every neighborhood in Queens — Astoria, Flushing, Jamaica, Long Island City, Forest Hills, Jackson Heights, and dozens more. Each neighborhood gets its own optimized pages for every service type we support.",
    },
    {
      q: "How does SEO help lawyers get more clients in NYC?",
      a: "Legal keywords are some of the most expensive in Google Ads — $50–$200+ per click. When someone searches 'personal injury lawyer Queens' and finds your organically ranked page instead of an ad, that's a free lead that closes at 8–10x the rate of paid clicks. We build pages for every legal specialty in every borough.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between local SEO and regular SEO?",
      a: "Local SEO targets customers in specific geographic areas — like neighborhoods across the NYC metro. Regular SEO targets broad, national keywords. For service businesses, local SEO is everything. You don't need someone in California finding your plumbing company. You need someone in Hoboken finding you right now.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why is Next.js better than WordPress for SEO?",
      a: "Next.js generates static HTML that loads instantly — no database queries, no bloated plugins, no security vulnerabilities. Google's Core Web Vitals heavily favor fast sites. WordPress sites average 3–5 second load times. Our Next.js platforms load in under 1 second. Speed is a direct ranking factor.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can you help my HVAC company rank in Westchester?",
      a: "Absolutely. HVAC in Westchester is one of our strongest verticals. We build dedicated pages for every town — White Plains, Yonkers, New Rochelle, Scarsdale, and more. Each page targets the exact searches homeowners make when their AC breaks or they need a furnace install.",
    },
    {
      q: "How many pages does an SEO platform include?",
      a: `It depends on how many services you offer and areas you serve. A single-service business in one borough might have 50–100 pages. A multi-service business across the metro area can have thousands. This site alone has ${totalPages.toLocaleString()}+ pages — every one targeting a real search query.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What should I look for when hiring an SEO agency in New York?",
      a: "Ask to see live pages they've built. Not screenshots. Not case studies from 2019. Live URLs you can search and find in Google right now. If they can't show you that, they're not doing real SEO. We show you everything we build — it's all public, indexable, and verifiable.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you help with Google My Business optimization?",
      a: "Yes. Your Google Business Profile is the first thing people see in local searches. Maps, reviews, photos, hours — if it's not optimized, you're invisible in the local pack. We make sure your GBP is dialed in and working alongside your organic SEO pages for maximum visibility.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do organic leads compare to paid leads for contractors?",
      a: "Organic leads close at 8–10x the rate of paid leads. When a homeowner searches 'general contractor Manhattan' and finds your page organically, they already trust you more than an ad. They're further along in their decision. And you paid $0 for that click.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is SEO worth it for a new business with no online presence?",
      a: "It's the best time to start. New businesses that invest in organic SEO from day one build an asset that compounds over time. While your competitors burn money on ads, you'll be building rankings across every neighborhood you serve. In 6–12 months, they're still paying per click. You're not.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I get started with The NYC SEO?",
      a: "Fill out a partnership request and tell us about your business — what you do, where you serve, and where you want to be. We'll review everything and show you exactly what we'd build: the pages, the structured data, the full strategy. No cost to look. No commitment. Just an honest conversation.",

                An EMD (Exact Match Domain) microsite is a small, focused website built on a domain that matches what your customers search for &mdash; like &ldquo;brooklynplumber.com.&rdquo; Search engines give weight to domain relevance, so these sites often rank faster than a generic business website.

                Word of mouth is great but it doesn&apos;t scale. Every day, people in <Link href="/areas" className="text-white underline hover:text-blue-200">your area</Link> search for your exact service and find your competitors instead.

                Programmatic SEO means building hundreds or thousands of optimized pages at scale &mdash; each targeting a specific service + location keyword. Instead of writing one blog post and hoping it ranks, we build a page for every combination like <Link href="/plumber/brooklyn-heights" className="text-white underline hover:text-blue-200">plumber in Brooklyn Heights</Link> or <Link href="/electrician/jersey-city" className="text-white underline hover:text-blue-200">electrician in Jersey City</Link>.

If all you&apos;re getting is monthly reports with traffic charts, you&apos;re probably paying for nothing. With us, you can <Link href="/services" className="text-white underline hover:text-blue-200">see every page we build</Link> &mdash; they&apos;re live and indexable right now.

              <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-6 text-blue-100">
                Structured data (schema markup) tells search engines exactly what your business does, where you are, and what services you offer &mdash; in a language they understand. It&apos;s how you show up in rich results, local packs, and AI search answers. Every page we build includes 100% valid structured data. Most agencies skip this entirely.

                Yes &mdash; and they already are. AI search converts at 4&ndash;5x the rate of traditional search. When someone asks ChatGPT or Perplexity for a <Link href="/plumber/manhattan" className="text-white underline hover:text-blue-200">plumber in Manhattan</Link>, the answer comes from pages with clean, parseable data. That&apos;s exactly how we build every page &mdash; optimized for both traditional search and AI platforms.

                Most agencies completely ignore these engines &mdash; which is exactly why it&apos;s easier to rank on them. Bing powers every Windows device and Microsoft Edge. Yahoo has 700M+ monthly users with higher income demographics. DuckDuckGo is the fastest growing traditional search engine. We optimize for <Link href="/about" className="text-white underline hover:text-blue-200">all of them at the same time</Link>.

Regular SEO targets broad, national keywords. For service businesses, local SEO is everything. You don&apos;t need someone in California finding your plumbing company.

                Next.js generates static HTML that loads instantly &mdash; no database queries, no bloated plugins, no security vulnerabilities. Google&apos;s Core Web Vitals heavily favor fast sites. WordPress sites average 3&ndash;5 second load times. Our Next.js platforms load in under 1 second.

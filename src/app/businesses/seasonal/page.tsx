const faqs = [
  {
    q: "When should a snow removal business start investing in SEO?",
    a: "Start in summer. Seriously. Property managers and homeowners begin searching for snow removal contracts in September and October. If your SEO campaign launches in November, you've already missed the highest-intent searches. The businesses that rank when the first storm hits are the ones that invested months earlier. SEO is not instant — it takes 3-6 months to build authority.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can SEO work for a business that only operates part of the year?",
    a: "Absolutely — and seasonal businesses arguably need SEO more than year-round ones. Your revenue window is compressed, so every lead matters more. We build evergreen content and authority that keeps your site ranking year-round, so when the season hits, you're already at the top. We also use the off-season to create content about winter preparation, seasonal contracts, and property maintenance.",
  },
  {
    q: "What keywords should a snow removal business target?",
    a: "High-value keywords include 'snow removal [neighborhood],' 'snow plowing service NYC,' 'commercial snow removal Brooklyn,' and 'residential sidewalk clearing near me.' We also target pre-season terms like 'snow removal contract NYC' and 'winter property maintenance' that capture customers planning ahead. Long-tail queries like 'snow removal for co-op buildings Manhattan' signal serious commercial intent.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you optimize for the seasonal search spike?",
    a: "We build the foundation during the off-season — site authority, content, backlinks, and technical SEO — so your pages are already ranking when search volume surges. During the season, we publish timely storm content, update Google Business Profile with real-time availability, and run targeted campaigns around major weather events. This combination means you capture traffic at the exact moment demand peaks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Google Business Profile matter for snow removal companies?",
    a: "It's critical. When someone searches 'snow removal near me' during a storm, Google Maps results dominate the page. Your GBP needs accurate service areas, winter hours, emergency contact info, and recent reviews. We optimize every element and build a review strategy that generates fresh testimonials each season — because a review from last winter is better than no review at all.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's included in the $3,500/month retainer for seasonal businesses?",
    a: "The retainer covers year-round SEO: keyword strategy, on-page optimization, Google Business Profile management, content creation, local citation building, link building, AI search optimization, and monthly reporting. For seasonal businesses we front-load intensive work before peak season and shift to maintenance and content building during the off-season.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can AI search optimization help a snow removal business?",
    a: "Yes. When property managers ask ChatGPT 'best snow removal company in Queens' or homeowners ask Perplexity 'reliable snow plowing service NYC,' your business needs to appear in those answers. AI search tools pull from authoritative, well-structured websites with strong local signals — exactly what we build. This channel is growing fast and early movers have a significant advantage.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you build websites for seasonal service businesses?",
    a: "Yes. We build fast, conversion-focused websites with features seasonal businesses need: service area maps, seasonal contract request forms, emergency service callouts, real-time availability status, and prominent phone numbers. Every site is mobile-optimized because most emergency seasonal searches happen on phones during weather events.",

            Seasonal businesses face a unique SEO challenge: you need to be ranking
            before the season starts, not scrambling when it arrives. NYC averages
            28 inches of snow per year, with sidewalk clearing fines starting at $100.
            Every property owner needs a provider &mdash; and the first place they look is
            Google.{" "}

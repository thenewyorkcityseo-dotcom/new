      q: "How much does SEO cost for a service business in NYC?",
      a: "Monthly retainers start at $3,500/month for a full-service SEO campaign covering on-page optimization, local SEO, Google Business Profile, content marketing, link building, and AI search optimization. Project-based work starts at $2,500. Hourly consulting from $150/hour. The exact cost depends on your industry, competitive landscape, and how many neighborhoods you want to target. A plumber targeting 5 neighborhoods needs less investment than a law firm targeting all of Manhattan.",
    },
    {
      q: "What types of businesses do you do SEO for?",
      a: `We build SEO and AI search platforms for ${totalServices} service business types across 15 industries — home services (plumbers, electricians, HVAC), healthcare (dentists, chiropractors, med spas), legal (personal injury, divorce, immigration), financial, automotive, beauty, fitness, food & dining, events, education, business services, real estate, pet services, lifestyle, and seasonal businesses. If you serve customers locally, we can rank you.`,
    },
    {
      q: "How long does SEO take to work for local businesses in NYC?",
      a: "Most local service businesses see measurable improvements in 60-90 days, with significant ranking gains in 4-6 months. Google Business Profile optimizations can impact your Maps ranking within weeks. Programmatic location pages typically start ranking in 60-120 days. Highly competitive industries like personal injury law or cosmetic dentistry may take 6-12 months for top positions. We provide monthly reporting so you see progress from week one.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you only work with businesses in New York City?",
      a: `We serve businesses across the entire NYC metro area — all five boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island), Northern New Jersey, Long Island (Nassau and Suffolk counties), and Westchester County. That is ${totalNeighborhoods}+ neighborhoods with dedicated landing pages for each. If your service area touches the NYC metro, we can rank you.`,
    },
    {
      q: "What is programmatic SEO and how does it work for local businesses?",
      a: `Programmatic SEO is the automated generation of optimized landing pages at scale. For a plumber serving the NYC metro, we build ${totalNeighborhoods}+ pages — one for every neighborhood. "Plumber in Park Slope," "Plumber in Astoria," "Plumber in Hoboken" — each with unique content, proper schema markup, and internal linking. When someone searches "[your service] in [neighborhood]," your dedicated page is what ranks. This is how we build ${totalPages.toLocaleString()}+ page platforms.`,
    },
    {
      q: "Can you help my business show up on ChatGPT and Perplexity?",
      a: "Yes. AI search optimization (also called Generative Engine Optimization or GEO) is one of our core services. We structure your content with entity relationships, authority signals, and citation patterns that AI platforms use when formulating recommendations. When someone asks ChatGPT 'best plumber in Brooklyn' or 'recommended dentist Upper East Side,' we make sure your business is the one that gets recommended — not your competitor.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is the difference between your SEO and typical agency SEO?",
      a: "Three things. First, we build on Next.js — not WordPress — so your site scores 95+ on Core Web Vitals and loads in under 1 second. Second, we use programmatic SEO to generate hundreds of location-specific pages, each with unique content and schema. Third, we optimize for AI search platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude) in addition to Google — something 95% of agencies still ignore. We also offer Full Loop CRM so your leads actually get followed up on.",
    },
    {
      q: "What is Full Loop CRM and do I need it?",
      a: "Full Loop CRM is the first full-cycle CRM built for service businesses. It manages the entire journey from the first Google search to the 5-star review — organic lead generation, AI sales assistant, scheduling, GPS field operations, payments, reviews, and retargeting. One platform replaces 9+ standalone tools. It is territory-exclusive, meaning your competitors cannot use it in your area. It is optional but recommended for businesses serious about converting the leads our SEO generates.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you offer SEO for franchise or multi-location businesses?",
      a: "Yes. Multi-location SEO is one of our specialties. Each location gets its own Google Business Profile, dedicated landing pages, localized citation strategy, separate review generation, and location-specific content. We manage campaigns for businesses with 2 to 50+ locations across the NYC metro. Each location gets a tailored strategy based on its competitive landscape and neighborhood demographics.",
    },
    {
      q: "What SEO results can I expect for my local business?",
      a: "Results vary by industry and competition, but typical outcomes include: 3-5x increase in organic traffic within 6 months, top-3 Google Maps ranking for primary service + neighborhood keywords, 40-60% increase in phone calls from organic search, and measurable AI search presence on ChatGPT and Perplexity. We provide monthly ranking reports, traffic analytics, call tracking, and lead attribution so you see exactly what your investment produces.",

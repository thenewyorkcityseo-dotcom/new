const faqs = [
  {
    q: "How long does SEO take for an education business in NYC?",
    a: "Most education businesses start seeing measurable gains in organic traffic within 3-5 months. Competitive terms like 'SAT tutoring NYC' or 'dance classes Manhattan' may take 6-9 months to crack page one, but local long-tail terms like 'piano lessons Upper East Side' can rank faster with proper local SEO and Google Business Profile optimization.",
  },
  {
    q: "What SEO services matter most for tutoring companies?",
    a: "Local SEO and Google Business Profile optimization are the highest-impact services for tutors. Parents search by subject and neighborhood -- 'math tutor Park Slope' or 'reading tutor Astoria.' We build neighborhood-specific pages, optimize your GBP listing, and create content targeting the exact subjects and test prep services you offer.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can SEO help a dance studio or music school compete with ClassPass and aggregators?",
    a: "Yes. Aggregator sites rank for broad terms, but parents and students search for specific, local instruction -- 'ballet classes for kids Brooklyn' or 'guitar lessons for beginners Queens.' We build pages targeting those long-tail searches where your studio can outrank aggregators and capture direct enrollments without paying referral fees.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does SEO cost for education businesses?",
    a: "Our monthly retainer for education businesses starts at $3,500/month, which covers local SEO, content marketing, Google Business Profile management, and AI search optimization. One-time projects like website redesigns start at $2,500. Strategy consulting is available at $150/hour for businesses that want guidance without a full retainer.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you build separate pages for each subject or program we offer?",
    a: "Absolutely. A tutoring company offering SAT prep, math tutoring, and reading support needs separate optimized pages for each service. We create dedicated landing pages for every subject, age group, and location you serve -- maximizing the number of searches your site appears in and matching parent intent precisely.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does AI search optimization help education businesses?",
    a: "AI platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews are increasingly where parents research education options. We optimize your content so it gets cited in AI-generated answers to queries like 'best music schools in NYC' or 'top SAT prep services near me.' This is a new channel most competitors are ignoring entirely.",
  },
  {
    q: "What results can a language school expect from SEO?",
    a: "Language schools typically see 40-80% increases in organic enrollment inquiries within 6-8 months. We target language-specific and neighborhood-specific terms, build content around common search patterns like 'Spanish classes for adults NYC,' and optimize for Google Maps where local intent dominates.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should driving schools invest in SEO or just rely on Google Ads?",
    a: "Both, but SEO delivers compounding returns that ads never will. Every month you run Google Ads, you pay again. Every month your SEO pages rank, they generate free traffic. We build pages for terms like 'driving school near me' and 'road test prep [borough]' that continue driving enrollments long after the initial investment.",

            The education market in New York City is one of the most competitive in the country.
            Parents are researching tutors, enrichment programs, and schools online before they
            ever pick up the phone. If your website does not rank for the subjects, neighborhoods,
            and program types families are searching for, you are handing enrollments to the
            competition.

const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What does a marketing consultant actually do for my business?",
    a: "A marketing consultant provides CMO-level strategic oversight without the CMO salary. We analyze your current marketing efforts, identify gaps and opportunities, develop a comprehensive multi-channel strategy, and create an actionable roadmap that aligns marketing spend with revenue goals. For NYC service businesses, this means auditing your SEO, paid advertising, social media, referral systems, reputation management, and lead nurturing workflows — then prioritizing the channels that will generate the highest return for your specific market, service area, and competitive landscape. We do not execute random tactics. We build a strategic framework that makes every marketing dollar work harder.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does marketing consulting cost in NYC?",
    a: "Our marketing consulting engagements start at $350 per hour for focused strategy sessions and go up to $500 per hour for executive-level advisory that includes ongoing implementation oversight. Monthly retainers range from $5,000 to $10,000 per month depending on scope, meeting frequency, and the complexity of your marketing ecosystem. For businesses that need a full marketing overhaul, our Foundation tier starts at $3,500 per month, Growth at $7,500 per month, and Domination at $15,000+ per month — these include marketing strategy plus execution across SEO, content, paid media, and automation. Every dollar goes into strategy and results — not overhead, not junior account managers, not bloated reporting decks.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a marketing consultant and a marketing agency?",
    a: "A marketing agency executes tactics — they run your ads, post your social content, send your emails. A marketing consultant provides strategic direction — we determine which tactics to pursue, how to allocate your budget, what channels to prioritize, and how to measure success. Think of it as the difference between a pilot and an air traffic controller. Most service businesses do not need more execution — they need better strategy. We often work alongside your existing agency or in-house team, providing the strategic oversight that ensures every marketing dollar is spent on the right channel at the right time targeting the right audience.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is marketing consulting different from hiring a fractional CMO?",
    a: "In practice, our marketing consulting engagements function as fractional CMO relationships. You get CMO-level strategic thinking, market analysis, competitive intelligence, and growth planning without the $250,000 to $400,000 annual salary that a full-time CMO commands. The difference is flexibility — our consulting engagements can scale from a few hours per month to a full strategic partnership, and you are not locked into a long-term employment contract. For most NYC service businesses generating $1 million to $20 million in revenue, a fractional CMO through consulting delivers significantly more value per dollar than a full-time hire.",
  },
  {
    q: "What industries do you specialize in for marketing consulting?",
    a: "We specialize exclusively in local service businesses across the NYC metro area — plumbers, electricians, HVAC contractors, roofers, general contractors, personal injury lawyers, dentists, therapists, cleaning services, landscapers, salons, and over 150 additional service categories. We do not consult for e-commerce brands, SaaS companies, or national retail chains. Our deep specialization in service businesses means we understand the lead generation dynamics, seasonal patterns, competitive landscapes, and customer acquisition costs that are unique to your industry. Generic marketing consultants give generic advice. We give advice built on 20+ years of service business marketing data.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a marketing consulting engagement typically last?",
    a: "Our initial strategy engagements typically run 90 days — enough time to audit your current marketing, develop a comprehensive strategy, create an implementation roadmap, and begin measuring results. Many clients continue with ongoing monthly retainers for continuous strategic oversight, performance monitoring, and strategy adjustment. Marketing is not a one-time project — the competitive landscape shifts, channels evolve, and your business grows. The businesses that win are the ones that invest in continuous strategic refinement. That said, we do not lock you into long-term contracts. If we are not delivering value, you can walk away at any time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you help with implementation or just strategy?",
    a: "We provide both. Our core offering is strategic consulting — the thinking, planning, and decision-making that determines where your marketing dollars go. But we also offer implementation support across every channel we recommend. If your strategy calls for SEO, we have a dedicated SEO team. If it calls for a website rebuild, we build on Next.js. If it calls for automation, we build it with our proprietary CRM platform Full Loop CRM. If it calls for content, we create it. The advantage of working with us over a pure strategy consultancy is that we can execute every recommendation we make. No handoffs. No translation losses. No waiting for a third-party vendor to interpret our strategy document.",
  },
  {
    q: "What marketing channels do you typically recommend for NYC service businesses?",
    a: "For most NYC service businesses, the highest-ROI channel mix is SEO plus Google Business Profile plus reputation management plus a referral system. These four channels capture customers at the moment of intent — when they are actively searching for your service. Beyond that, the channel mix depends on your specific business. High-ticket services like legal and dental benefit from content marketing and paid search. Home services benefit from local SEO and programmatic page generation. Recurring services benefit from email nurturing and automation. We never recommend a channel because it is trendy — we recommend it because the data shows it will generate positive ROI for your specific business.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you measure the success of a marketing consulting engagement?",
    a: "We measure success the same way you do — revenue. Specifically, we track qualified leads per month, cost per lead by channel, lead-to-customer conversion rate, customer acquisition cost, customer lifetime value, and marketing ROI by channel. We also track leading indicators like keyword rankings, organic traffic, Google Business Profile visibility, review velocity, and brand mention growth. Every metric ties back to one question: is your marketing generating more revenue this month than last month at a sustainable cost per acquisition? If the answer is not yes, we adjust strategy until it is.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you audit my current marketing and tell me what is working?",
    a: "Yes — every engagement starts with a comprehensive marketing audit. We analyze your website performance, SEO health, paid advertising efficiency, social media ROI, email marketing metrics, review profile, Google Business Profile optimization, competitive positioning, and lead attribution data. The audit typically takes 15 to 20 hours and results in a detailed report that identifies what is generating ROI, what is wasting money, what opportunities you are missing, and what your competitors are doing that you are not. This audit becomes the foundation of your entire marketing strategy. Many businesses discover they are spending 30% to 50% of their marketing budget on channels that generate zero measurable return.",
  },
  {
    q: "What makes The NYC SEO different from other marketing consultants?",
    a: "Three things differentiate us. First, we own the technology — we build on Next.js, deploy on Vercel, use Supabase for data, and built our own CRM (Full Loop CRM). When we recommend a technical solution, we build it ourselves instead of outsourcing to a third party. Second, we specialize exclusively in NYC service businesses. We do not consult for tech startups or national brands — we know the NYC service market because we have been working in it for over 20 years. Third, we are results-driven to the point of obsession. We do not produce 50-page strategy documents that sit in a drawer. We produce actionable roadmaps, execute them, measure the results, and adjust. Every recommendation we make is backed by data and tied to revenue.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need marketing consulting if I already have an SEO agency?",
    a: "An SEO agency optimizes your search visibility. A marketing consultant ensures your entire marketing ecosystem works together. SEO is one channel — an important one, but still one channel. If your SEO is driving traffic but your website does not convert, your phone system drops calls, your review profile is weak, or your follow-up process loses leads, you are leaving money on the table. Marketing consulting provides the strategic layer that sits above individual channel execution and ensures every piece of your marketing machine works together to generate and close leads. Many of our consulting clients already have SEO agencies — they hire us to make sure the whole system is optimized, not just one piece.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you handle businesses that have tried marketing consultants before with no results?",
    a: "Most marketing consultants fail service businesses for one of three reasons: they lack industry specialization, they deliver strategy without execution capability, or they measure vanity metrics instead of revenue. We solve all three. We specialize in NYC service businesses — no generalists, no guessing. We execute everything we recommend — no handoffs, no translation losses. And we measure leads and revenue — not impressions, not engagement rates, not brand awareness scores. If your previous consultant gave you a 50-page PDF and disappeared, you did not get consulting — you got a document. We provide ongoing strategic partnership with measurable outcomes.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you help me figure out my marketing budget?",
    a: "Budget allocation is one of the most important deliverables in our consulting engagements. We analyze your revenue goals, customer acquisition costs, customer lifetime value, and competitive landscape to determine the optimal marketing investment level. For most NYC service businesses, marketing spend should be 7% to 15% of target revenue — but how you allocate that budget across channels is what determines your ROI. We build a channel-by-channel budget model that projects expected leads, cost per lead, and revenue return for every dollar spent. This eliminates the guesswork that causes most businesses to overspend on low-performing channels and underspend on high-performing ones.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens during the first 30 days of a consulting engagement?",
    a: "The first 30 days are dedicated to discovery and audit. We conduct a deep-dive into your business — revenue goals, service offerings, target areas, competitive landscape, current marketing channels, lead flow, conversion process, and customer journey. We audit every active marketing channel for performance and ROI. We analyze your top 5 competitors to identify gaps and opportunities. We review your technology stack, CRM, phone system, and lead management process. By day 30, you have a comprehensive marketing audit, a prioritized list of opportunities, and a 90-day strategic roadmap with specific actions, timelines, and projected outcomes. No fluff. No theory. Just a clear plan to generate more revenue.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer one-time strategy sessions or only ongoing retainers?",
    a: "We offer both. One-time strategy sessions are $350 to $500 per hour and are ideal for businesses that need focused advice on a specific challenge — launching a new service, entering a new market, evaluating a marketing vendor, or troubleshooting a specific channel. Ongoing retainers at $5,000 to $10,000 per month provide continuous strategic oversight, monthly performance reviews, quarterly strategy updates, and on-demand advisory access. Most clients start with a one-time audit or strategy session, see the value, and transition to an ongoing retainer. We do not pressure anyone into long-term commitments — the results do the selling.",

              — the marketing landscape in 2026 is more complex than ever. You are competing across Google organic search, Google Maps, paid search, AI search platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity, social media, review sites, referral networks, and email. Each channel has its own rules, its own costs, and its own ROI profile.

              Most service business owners are not marketing experts — nor should they be. You are an expert at your trade. But without strategic marketing direction, you end up in one of two traps: either you spend too little on marketing and grow too slowly, or you spend too much on the wrong channels and wonder why revenue is flat despite a five-figure monthly marketing budget. A marketing consultant eliminates this uncertainty by providing the strategic clarity that turns marketing spend into a predictable growth engine.

This is not a surface-level intake call. We spend 10 to 15 hours in discovery because getting the diagnosis right is the most important step in the entire process.

Social media — engagement rates, lead attribution, ROI analysis. Reputation — review volume, average rating, response strategy, competitive comparison. Email and nurturing — open rates, click rates, lead re-engagement performance. We also audit what you are not doing — the channels your competitors use that you do not, the keywords they rank for that you miss, the audiences they target that you overlook.

The strategy is specific, measurable, and tied directly to your revenue goals.

If your strategy calls for a new website, the roadmap includes design, development, content creation, and launch timelines.

If you need us to execute directly, we have in-house capabilities for SEO, web development on Next.js, content creation, marketing automation through Full Loop CRM, and AI search optimization.

          <p className="mt-4 text-zinc-400">
            Service business owners typically weigh three options for marketing leadership. Here is how they compare.

              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                A full-time Chief Marketing Officer in New York City commands a salary of $250,000 to $400,000 per year, plus benefits, equity, and bonuses. For most service businesses generating $1 million to $20 million in annual revenue, that is an enormous commitment for a single hire — especially when you consider the ramp-up time, the risk of a bad hire, and the fact that a CMO still needs a team to execute. Our marketing consulting engagements deliver the same strategic output — market analysis, channel strategy, budget optimization, competitive positioning, and growth planning — at $60,000 to $120,000 per year on a retainer basis. You get CMO-level thinking without the CMO-level overhead. And because we work with dozens of service businesses across the NYC metro, we bring cross-industry insights and benchmarking data that a single in-house CMO simply cannot match.

              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                Many service business owners try to handle marketing themselves — and there is nothing wrong with that at the earliest stages. But as your business grows beyond $500,000 in annual revenue, the opportunity cost of the owner managing marketing becomes enormous. Every hour you spend researching keywords, tweaking Google Ads, writing social posts, or figuring out email automation is an hour you are not spending on sales, operations, or the trade that built your business. DIY marketing also suffers from a lack of perspective — you are too close to your own business to objectively evaluate what is working and what is not. A marketing consultant provides the outside perspective, strategic experience, and data-driven frameworks that eliminate guesswork and accelerate growth. The ROI is not subtle — most clients see a 3x to 5x return on their consulting investment within the first 6 months.

              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                Most marketing agencies operate on a retainer model where they execute specific tactics — run your ads, manage your social media, produce your content. The problem is that most agencies execute without strategy. They run the playbook they run for every client, regardless of whether those tactics are the right fit for your specific business, market, and growth stage. A marketing consultant sits above the agency layer and provides strategic direction. We determine which tactics should be executed, which channels deserve investment, and how to measure success. Many of our consulting clients have existing agency relationships — we make those agencies more effective by ensuring they are doing the right work, not just doing work. Think of it this way: an agency is the engine, but a marketing consultant is the GPS that tells the engine where to go.

              &ldquo;We were spending $12,000 a month on marketing across five different channels and had no idea what was actually generating leads. The NYC SEO audited everything, cut two channels that were producing zero measurable return, reallocated that budget to SEO and Google Business Profile, and within 6 months our cost per lead dropped by 60% while lead volume increased by 40%. The strategic clarity alone was worth ten times the consulting fee. We finally understand where our money goes and what it produces.&rdquo;

            10 Marketing Mistakes NYC Service Businesses Make (and How We Fix Them)

            {[
              {
                mistake: "Spreading budget across too many channels without data",
                fix: "Most service businesses are active on 5 to 7 marketing channels but only 2 to 3 generate positive ROI. We audit every channel, identify the winners, and reallocate budget from underperforming channels to high-performing ones. This alone typically increases lead volume by 30% to 50% without increasing total spend.",
              },
              {
                mistake: "No clear understanding of cost per lead by channel",
                fix: "If you do not know what a lead costs from Google Ads versus SEO versus Yelp versus referrals, you are flying blind. We implement lead attribution tracking across every channel so you know exactly what each lead costs and which channels deliver the best quality leads that actually close into paying customers.",
              },
              {
                mistake: "Investing in social media when search intent drives your industry",
                fix: "For most service businesses, social media generates brand awareness but almost zero direct leads. A plumber does not get emergency calls from Instagram. We redirect social media budget to search-based channels — SEO, Google Ads, Google Business Profile — where customers are actively looking for your service right now.",
              },
              {
                mistake: "No competitive analysis — marketing in a vacuum",
                fix: "Your competitors' marketing strategy directly impacts yours. If three competitors are dominating Google for your top keywords, your strategy needs to account for that. We analyze your top 10 competitors across every channel — their keywords, their ad spend, their review velocity, their content strategy — and identify gaps you can exploit.",
              },
              {
                mistake: "Chasing the latest marketing trend instead of building fundamentals",
                fix: "TikTok, AI chatbots, influencer marketing — every year there is a new shiny object. Fundamentals win. For service businesses, fundamentals are SEO, Google Business Profile, reputation management, and a solid referral system. We build the foundation first, then layer advanced tactics on top once the fundamentals are producing consistent results.",
              },
              {
                mistake: "No customer journey mapping — treating all leads the same",
                fix: "A homeowner researching 'best plumber in Brooklyn' is at a different stage than someone searching 'emergency pipe burst repair near me.' We map your customer journey from awareness to consideration to decision and build channel strategies and messaging for each stage. This increases conversion rates by meeting customers where they are.",
              },
              {
                mistake: "Paying agencies without holding them accountable to KPIs",
                fix: "If your marketing agency reports on impressions and clicks but not leads and revenue, they are hiding behind vanity metrics. We build KPI frameworks that tie every marketing activity to measurable outcomes — leads generated, cost per lead, conversion rate, and revenue attributed. If a channel or vendor is not delivering ROI, we know within 30 days.",
              },
              {
                mistake: "No follow-up system — losing leads after first contact",
                fix: "The average service business follows up with a new lead once and gives up. Studies show that 80% of sales require 5 or more follow-ups. We design and implement automated lead nurture workflows using our CRM platform, Full Loop CRM, that follow up with every lead via email, SMS, and phone until they convert or explicitly opt out.",
              },
              {
                mistake: "Ignoring reputation management and review generation",
                fix: "In NYC, reviews are your most powerful marketing asset. A business with 200 five-star Google reviews converts at 3x the rate of a competitor with 30 reviews. We build automated review generation systems that consistently produce new reviews from satisfied customers and implement response strategies that build trust with prospects reading those reviews.",
              },
              {
                mistake: "No marketing strategy document — running on gut feeling",
                fix: "Most service business owners make marketing decisions based on intuition, sales calls from vendors, or what their competitors appear to be doing. We replace gut feeling with data. Our consulting engagements produce a formal marketing strategy with channel priorities, budget allocations, KPI targets, and quarterly milestones. This document becomes the operating system for your marketing — every decision is measured against it.",

We have guided service businesses through every major marketing shift — from the rise of Google to the social media explosion to the current AI revolution. When we build a marketing strategy, it is informed by 20+ years of data on what actually works for service businesses in this market. We do not guess. We do not follow trends. We apply proven frameworks refined across hundreds of client engagements.

                and deploy on Vercel for web development. We use Supabase for data infrastructure. We use Resend for email delivery. We use Telnyx for voice and SMS. No WordPress. No bloated martech stacks. No third-party dependencies that slow you down or limit your capabilities. When we recommend a technical solution in your marketing strategy, we can build it ourselves — faster, cheaper, and better than outsourcing to a vendor who does not understand the strategy behind it.

                is our proprietary customer relationship management platform built specifically for service businesses. It handles lead capture, automated follow-up, appointment scheduling, review generation, and revenue attribution — all in one platform. When our marketing strategy calls for lead nurturing, CRM implementation, or automation, we do not recommend a third-party tool and hope it works. We deploy our own platform and configure it specifically for your business, your sales process, and your customer journey. This level of integration between strategy and technology is something no pure-play consulting firm can match.

                We do not produce 50-page strategy decks that sit in a drawer. We do not report on impressions, reach, or engagement. We measure leads, revenue, and ROI — the metrics that actually determine whether your marketing is working. Every recommendation we make is tied to a projected outcome. Every outcome is measured. Every measurement informs the next iteration of strategy. If something is not producing results, we change it — quickly, decisively, and without ego. Our reputation is built on one thing: generating measurable revenue growth for NYC service businesses. That is the only metric we care about, and it should be the only metric you care about too.

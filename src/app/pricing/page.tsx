const faqs = [
  {
    q: "How much does SEO cost per month in 2026?",
    a: "SEO costs anywhere from $500 to $25,000+ per month depending on scope, competition, and geography. Nationally, the average is $1,500 to $5,000 per month for a small business. In competitive metro areas like NYC, quality SEO typically starts at $3,000 to $5,000 per month and can exceed $15,000 per month for multi-location campaigns targeting high-value keywords. Agencies charging under $1,000 per month are almost always cutting corners — outsourcing to overseas content farms, using automated link schemes, or delivering templated work that does not move the needle.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between cheap SEO and premium SEO?",
    a: "Cheap SEO ($300-$1,000/mo) typically involves templated audits, spun content, low-quality directory links, and minimal reporting. Premium SEO ($3,500+/mo) involves custom keyword research, hand-written content optimized for both traditional and AI search engines, editorial-quality backlinks, full technical optimization, schema markup, and transparent reporting with lead attribution. The difference is not just quality — it is whether the work actually generates revenue. Cheap SEO wastes money slowly. Premium SEO is an investment that compounds.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is SEO worth it for small businesses?",
    a: "Yes, but only if you work with someone who understands your market. A plumber in NYC paying $3,500 per month for SEO can realistically generate 50-200+ organic leads per month within 6-12 months. If their average job is worth $500-$2,000, the ROI is massive — often 5x to 20x the investment. The key is targeting the right keywords, building the right content, and optimizing for both Google and AI search platforms. SEO compounds: the longer you invest, the cheaper your cost per lead becomes.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is NYC SEO more expensive than other markets?",
    a: "Three reasons. First, competition: every market in NYC is saturated with funded competitors, national brands, and aggregator sites (Yelp, Angi, Thumbtack) that dominate page one. Ranking requires significantly more content, more backlinks, and more technical sophistication. Second, keyword value: NYC service keywords have some of the highest CPCs in the country — $35 to $150+ per click on Google Ads. The organic equivalent of that traffic has enormous value. Third, labor costs: quality content writers, developers, and strategists in the NYC market command higher rates.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a monthly SEO retainer?",
    a: "A monthly SEO retainer is an ongoing engagement where you pay a fixed monthly fee for a defined scope of SEO work. This typically includes keyword research, on-page optimization, content creation, link building, technical SEO maintenance, schema markup, and monthly reporting. Retainers work best because SEO is not a one-time project — it requires sustained effort over months to build rankings, and those rankings need ongoing maintenance to hold. Most agencies structure retainers in tiers based on the number of services, locations, and keywords included.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is project-based SEO pricing?",
    a: "Project-based SEO pricing covers one-time deliverables with a clear scope and timeline. Examples include a comprehensive SEO audit ($2,500-$7,500), a website migration with SEO preservation ($7,500-$35,000), or a programmatic SEO build generating hundreds or thousands of optimized pages ($10,000-$35,000). Project-based pricing works well when you need a specific outcome rather than ongoing management. Many businesses start with a project (like an audit or website build) and then transition to a monthly retainer for ongoing optimization.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is performance-based SEO pricing?",
    a: "Performance-based SEO pricing ties agency compensation to results — usually rankings, traffic, or leads. While this sounds attractive, it comes with significant risks. Agencies may chase easy, low-value keywords to hit targets, use black-hat techniques for short-term gains, or define 'performance' in ways that do not align with your business goals. Most reputable agencies avoid pure performance-based models because quality SEO takes 3-6 months to show results, and the best strategies prioritize long-term sustainable growth over quick wins that may not last.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long before SEO starts generating leads?",
    a: "Most businesses see measurable ranking improvements within 60-90 days and meaningful lead generation within 4-6 months. Highly competitive NYC markets (personal injury law, HVAC, plumbing) may take 6-12 months for top-3 positions. The timeline depends on your current domain authority, competition level, website quality, and how aggressively you invest. SEO is a compounding investment — month 12 generates significantly more leads than month 3, and by month 18-24, your cost per lead is typically a fraction of what it was at the start.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I calculate the ROI of SEO?",
    a: "SEO ROI = (Revenue from organic leads - SEO investment) / SEO investment × 100. To calculate this, you need three numbers: your monthly organic traffic, your conversion rate, and your average customer value. For example, if SEO generates 100 leads per month, you close 20%, and each customer is worth $1,000, that is $20,000 in monthly revenue. If you are paying $7,500 per month for SEO, your ROI is 167%. The key metric to track is cost per lead from organic search versus cost per lead from paid channels.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I do SEO myself or hire an agency?",
    a: "If you have time to learn and your market is not highly competitive, DIY SEO can work for basic optimization — claiming your Google Business Profile, writing blog posts, fixing obvious technical issues. But for competitive markets like NYC, you need the expertise, tools, and time investment that only an experienced agency provides. The real question is opportunity cost: every hour you spend learning SEO is an hour not spent running your business. Most business owners generate more revenue by focusing on their craft and letting specialists handle the marketing.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should an SEO proposal include?",
    a: "A legitimate SEO proposal should include: a summary of your current visibility and rankings, a competitive analysis showing who ranks for your target keywords, a keyword strategy with search volume and difficulty data, a detailed scope of work (exactly what will be done each month), clear deliverables and timelines, pricing with no hidden fees, reporting methodology, and case studies or references from similar businesses. If a proposal is vague about what you are paying for, that is a red flag.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are red flags in SEO pricing?",
    a: "Major red flags include: guaranteed first-page rankings (no one can guarantee this), pricing under $500 per month for competitive markets, long-term contracts with no performance benchmarks, vague deliverables ('we will optimize your site'), proprietary tools or platforms you cannot access, no reporting or transparency into what work is being done, and agencies that cannot show case studies from businesses similar to yours. Also be wary of agencies that own your website or domain — you should always retain full ownership of your digital assets.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is SEO better than Google Ads?",
    a: "They serve different purposes. Google Ads delivers immediate traffic but stops the moment you stop paying — and NYC service keywords cost $35-$150+ per click. SEO takes longer to build but generates free organic traffic that compounds over time. At $7,500 per month in SEO, most businesses generate 200-500+ organic leads within 12 months at a cost per lead of $15-$37, compared to $150-$400 per lead on Google Ads. The best strategy is usually SEO as the foundation with targeted ads for immediate lead flow while rankings build.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between local SEO and national SEO?",
    a: "Local SEO targets customers in a specific geographic area — optimizing for 'plumber in Brooklyn' or 'dentist near Times Square.' It focuses on Google Business Profile, local citations, review management, and location-specific content. National SEO targets broader, non-geographic keywords — 'best CRM software' or 'how to choose a plumber.' Local SEO is generally less expensive ($2,000-$7,500/mo) because the competitive landscape is smaller. National SEO campaigns can cost $10,000-$50,000+/mo because you are competing against the entire country.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer contracts or month-to-month?",
    a: "We offer month-to-month engagements with no long-term contracts. We believe the work should speak for itself. If we are generating results, you stay. If we are not, you leave. That said, SEO is a 6-12 month investment — the compounding nature of organic search means results accelerate over time. Clients who commit to 12+ months consistently see the best ROI because rankings build on each other. We provide monthly reporting so you can see exactly what work was done and what results it generated.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is included in your $3,500/month Foundation plan?",
    a: "The Foundation plan includes: a comprehensive SEO audit and keyword strategy, on-page optimization for up to 50 pages, full technical SEO and Core Web Vitals optimization, local citation building across 50+ directories, Google Business Profile optimization, schema markup with 5+ JSON-LD types per page, monthly reporting with lead attribution, and hosting on our Next.js infrastructure. This plan is designed for single-location service businesses targeting one borough or region in NYC.",
  },
  {
    q: "What makes your SEO agency different from others in NYC?",
    a: "Three things. First, we build on Next.js — not WordPress. Our sites load in under one second, score perfect Core Web Vitals, and are engineered from the ground up for search engine performance. Second, we optimize for AI search platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude) alongside Google and Bing — most agencies have not even started thinking about this. Third, we own Full Loop CRM, which means our clients get a fully integrated lead-to-revenue pipeline that no other agency can offer. Plus 20+ years of experience and hundreds of businesses ranked.",

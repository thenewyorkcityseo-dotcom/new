const faqs = [
  {
    q: "How long does SEO take to show results in NYC?",
    a: "Most NYC service businesses see measurable ranking improvements within 90 to 120 days. Competitive industries like personal injury law or HVAC may take 6 months for top-3 positions. We provide monthly progress reports so you see movement from week one — indexation improvements, keyword position changes, and traffic growth. SEO is a compounding investment: the longer you maintain it, the harder it becomes for competitors to catch up.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much do SEO services cost in New York City?",
    a: "Our NYC SEO campaigns start at $3,500 per month for single-location service businesses. Multi-location and multi-borough campaigns range from $7,500 to $15,000+ per month depending on scope, competition level, and the number of service areas you need to dominate. Hourly consulting starts at $150 per hour for implementation work and goes up to $500 per hour for executive-level strategic advisory. Every dollar goes directly into strategy, content, technical optimization, and link building — no fluff, no vanity metrics.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between on-page SEO and off-page SEO?",
    a: "On-page SEO covers everything on your website — title tags, meta descriptions, heading structure, content optimization, internal linking, schema markup, image optimization, and site speed. Off-page SEO covers everything that happens outside your website — backlink acquisition, local citations, Google Business Profile optimization, review management, and brand mentions across the web. You need both to rank. We handle both as part of every campaign.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you guarantee first page rankings on Google?",
    a: "No legitimate SEO agency guarantees specific rankings — Google explicitly warns against companies that make this claim. What we guarantee is a transparent process, measurable progress, and a team that has been ranking NYC businesses for over 25 years. Our track record speaks for itself: we consistently move service businesses into top-3 positions for their target keywords within 6 to 12 months.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is local SEO and why does my NYC business need it?",
    a: "Local SEO optimizes your online presence to attract customers from specific geographic areas. For NYC service businesses, this means ranking in Google Maps, appearing in the local pack for searches like 'plumber near me Brooklyn' or 'dentist Upper East Side,' and building location-specific landing pages that target every neighborhood you serve. Over 46% of all Google searches have local intent — if you are not doing local SEO, you are invisible to nearly half of your potential customers.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is technical SEO and does my website need it?",
    a: "Technical SEO ensures search engines can crawl, index, and understand your website efficiently. This includes site speed optimization, mobile responsiveness, structured data markup, XML sitemaps, canonical tags, robots.txt configuration, Core Web Vitals, and crawl budget management. If your site is built on WordPress with bloated plugins, your technical SEO is almost certainly holding you back. We build on Next.js specifically because it solves most technical SEO problems at the framework level.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between SEO and PPC (Google Ads)?",
    a: "PPC gives you immediate visibility but stops the moment you stop paying. SEO takes longer to build but generates free organic traffic indefinitely. The average cost-per-click for service keywords in NYC ranges from $15 to $85. A single page ranking organically for that keyword saves you thousands per month. Most of our clients run PPC during their first 90 days of SEO, then scale ads down as organic rankings take over. SEO has a 5x to 12x better ROI than PPC over a 12-month period.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is SEO different for service businesses versus e-commerce?",
    a: "Service businesses compete on local intent — 'electrician near me,' 'personal injury lawyer Brooklyn,' 'HVAC repair Queens.' E-commerce competes on product intent — 'buy running shoes online.' The strategies are fundamentally different. Service SEO requires Google Business Profile optimization, local citations, location-specific landing pages, review management, and schema markup for LocalBusiness. We specialize exclusively in service business SEO because the playbook is completely different from e-commerce.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you work with businesses outside of NYC?",
    a: "Our core service area covers the entire NYC metro — Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island, New Jersey, Long Island, and Westchester. We have deep expertise in these markets and the local search dynamics that drive rankings here. If your business serves customers in this region, we are the right fit. We do not take on clients in markets we do not understand.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is AI search optimization and should I care about it?",
    a: "AI search optimization — also called Generative Engine Optimization or GEO — ensures your business gets recommended when someone asks ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, or Claude for a service provider. Over 100 million people use ChatGPT monthly, and AI search is growing faster than any channel since mobile. We optimize your structured data, content clarity, and entity associations so AI models recommend your business. This is not future-proofing — this is right now.",
  },
  {
    q: "What makes The NYC SEO different from other SEO agencies?",
    a: "Three things. First, we build on Next.js — not WordPress. This means your site loads in under 1 second, passes Core Web Vitals automatically, and scales to tens of thousands of pages without breaking. Second, we generate hundreds of optimized pages programmatically, targeting every service plus neighborhood combination your business serves. Third, we optimize for AI search platforms alongside traditional search engines. Most agencies are still stuck in 2019. We build for 2026 and beyond.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you measure SEO success?",
    a: "We track keyword rankings across Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and AI platforms. We monitor organic traffic, click-through rates, and impressions in Google Search Console. We attribute phone calls and form submissions to specific pages and keywords. And we report on Core Web Vitals, crawl health, and indexation status monthly. Everything ties back to one question: are you getting more qualified leads this month than last month?",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you fix a Google penalty or ranking drop?",
    a: "Yes. We diagnose manual actions, algorithmic penalties, and sudden ranking drops. Common causes include thin content, unnatural backlink profiles, duplicate content, and technical crawl errors. We perform a full audit, identify the root cause, submit reconsideration requests if needed, and rebuild your site authority with clean, white-hat practices. Recovery timelines vary — manual action recoveries can take 2 to 8 weeks after the fix is submitted.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is programmatic SEO and how does it help my business?",
    a: "Programmatic SEO uses data and automation to generate hundreds or thousands of optimized pages at scale. For a plumber serving 50 neighborhoods, we generate 50 unique landing pages — one for each location — each targeting real search queries like 'plumber in Park Slope' or 'emergency plumber Astoria.' Each page includes unique content, proper schema markup, and internal links. This approach would take a traditional agency months of manual work. We do it in days.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer monthly SEO reporting?",
    a: "Every client receives a detailed monthly SEO report covering keyword rankings, organic traffic trends, top-performing pages, new backlinks acquired, technical health scores, Core Web Vitals, and lead attribution data. We also include AI search visibility metrics — where your business appears in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI platforms. Reports are delivered with a recorded walkthrough so you understand exactly what the data means and what we are doing next.",
  },
  {
    q: "What industries do you specialize in for SEO?",
    a: "We specialize in local service businesses across NYC — plumbers, electricians, HVAC companies, roofers, painters, general contractors, lawyers, dentists, therapists, cleaning services, landscapers, salons, and over 150 additional service categories. If your customers search for your service on Google or ask AI for a recommendation, we know how to get you found.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many pages does my website need for SEO?",
    a: "It depends on how many services you offer and how many areas you serve. A plumber offering 8 services across 40 neighborhoods needs at least 320 service-location pages, plus service hub pages, area hub pages, a homepage, about page, and blog content. Most competitive service businesses in NYC need 500 to 5,000+ pages to fully cover their keyword landscape. We build platforms that scale to 50,000+ pages without performance degradation.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is WordPress good for SEO?",
    a: "WordPress can rank, but it comes with significant technical baggage — slow page loads, plugin conflicts, bloated code, security vulnerabilities, and poor Core Web Vitals scores. For a 10-page brochure site, WordPress is fine. For a competitive service business that needs thousands of optimized pages, fast load times, and clean structured data, WordPress becomes a liability. We build on Next.js because it eliminates these problems at the framework level and gives us complete control over every SEO element.",

              The difference between ranking first and ranking tenth on Google is the difference between getting 30% of the clicks and getting less than 2%. In competitive NYC markets, that gap translates to hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual revenue. SEO is not optional for service businesses that want to grow — it is the foundation everything else is built on.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold sm:text-4xl">SEO vs. Other Marketing Channels</h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-zinc-400">
            Every marketing channel has trade-offs. Here is how SEO compares to the alternatives NYC service businesses typically consider.
          </p>
          <div className="mt-10 space-y-8">
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#EFF70A]">SEO vs. PPC (Google Ads)</h3>
              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                Google Ads delivers instant visibility but stops the moment you stop paying. The average cost-per-click for service keywords in NYC ranges from $15 to $85 — a single lead can cost $150 to $400 through ads. SEO takes 3 to 6 months to build momentum, but once you rank, every click is free. Over a 12-month period, SEO delivers 5x to 12x better ROI than PPC for service businesses. Most of our clients run Google Ads during their first 90 days while SEO builds, then scale ads down as organic traffic takes over. The smartest approach is both — but SEO is the foundation that makes everything else more efficient.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#EFF70A]">SEO vs. Social Media Marketing</h3>
              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                Social media builds brand awareness, but it does not capture intent. When someone searches &ldquo;emergency plumber Brooklyn,&rdquo; they need a plumber right now. When someone scrolls past your Instagram post, they might remember your name — or they might not. For service businesses, search traffic converts at 3x to 8x the rate of social traffic because search captures demand at the moment of intent. Social media has its place in a marketing mix, but it should never be your primary lead channel if you are a service business.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#EFF70A]">SEO vs. Yelp, Angi & HomeAdvisor</h3>
              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                Lead aggregators charge $30 to $100+ per lead, share those leads with 3 to 5 competitors simultaneously, and give you zero control over lead quality. With SEO, you own your traffic. Your leads come to you directly. They visit your website, read your reviews, and call you — not you and four other companies at the same time. The cost per lead through organic search is a fraction of what aggregators charge, and the close rate is significantly higher because the customer has already chosen you before they pick up the phone.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#EFF70A]">SEO vs. Door-to-Door, Flyers & Traditional Advertising</h3>
              <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
                Traditional advertising casts a wide net and hopes for the best. SEO targets customers at the exact moment they are searching for your service. There is no wasted reach, no geographic spray, and no timing dependency. A flyer in a mailbox has a 1% to 2% response rate on a good day. A Google search result for &ldquo;best roofer in Queens&rdquo; converts at 15% to 30%. The math is not close.
